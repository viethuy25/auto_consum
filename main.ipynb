These forward -looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing \\nour views in  the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call.

A live webcast will also be \\naccessible from our Investor Relations website.  \\n \\nNow with that, I\\'d like to turn over the call to Matthew.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  \\nThank you, Phil. Q1 was a quarter of contrast. We achieved revenue of $290.2 million, up 37% year -over-year. \\nOur gross margin was 77.8%, again above our long -term target range of 75% to 77% and up from 77.4% last \\nquarter. During the quarter, we added 114 new  large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year \\nand now have 2,156 large customers, up 40% year -over-year. Our dollar -based net retention fell to 117%, down \\n5% quarter -over-quarter. Importantly, we did not see elevated churn across our broa d customer base. Instead, we \\nsaw slower expansion from existing customers. More on that in a second.  \\n \\nThroughout this quarter of contrast, we saw tailwinds and headwinds. The reacceleration of our new business \\npipeline during the second half of 2022 contin ued again this quarter, and we meaningfully exceeded our pipeline \\nplan for the second quarter in a row. Our win rate against the competition remained at record high levels, and \\nrenewal rates were consistent with the high levels experienced over the previou s four quarters. Those were all \\npositive signs.  \\n \\nOn the flip side, the quarter saw new challenges. Macroeconomic uncertainty, which intensified over the course of \\nQ1 with every failing bank, resulted in a material lengthening of sales cycles, a significant  decline in closed rates, \\neven as win rates held strong and an extreme back -end weighting to the quarter. To give you some sense, almost \\nhalf of the new business closed in the last two weeks of the quarter, which is very non -linear for us. All of these \\nfactors put pressure on growth. The quarter most reminded me of Q1 of 2020 when businesses were paralyzingly \\nnervous about the impact of COVID -19. I think this parallel shows how with uncertainty in the economy, \\ncompanies are closely watching their own busine sses before committing to new spending. Thankfully, we \\ncontinue to be a must -have, not a nice -to-have, and most of the deals we expected to close did just later than we \\nexpected.  \\n \\nI\\'m proud of our team\\'s ability to sail through the rough seas that characte rized Q1. Although the current economy \\nposes uncertainty for nearly every business in the near term, as Mark Hawkins on our board like to say, when the \\ngoing gets tough, the tough gets profitable, and we are tough. We have our hands firmly on the till\\'0er of our Cloudflare, Inc.  (NET) \\nQ1 2023 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \\n27-Apr-2023   \\n \\n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   4 \\nCopyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \\n \\nbusiness and are able to adjust to rapidly evolving market conditions in order to deliver our operating profit of \\n$19.4 million, representing a record operating margin of 6.7%.  \\n \\nFurthermore, in spite of tougher collections in the quarter, particular ly in the month of March, we generated $13.9 \\nmillion of free cash flow, representing a free cash flow margin of 5%. We continue to be on track to be free cash \\nflow positive for 2023.  \\n \\nAs we navigate through the challenging macroeconomic seas facing our ind ustry, this period of external \\nuncertainty presents us with a perfect opportunity to be internally reflective, identifying areas of improvement \\nwithin our business and taking proactive steps to create an even more successful and productive organization. As  \\nI take stock, we are not limited by the size of our market for our products. We are not limited by our ability to \\ninnovate. We are not limited by pipeline opportunity, and we are not limited by the sales capacity.  \\n \\nSo what are we limited by? As I said las t quarter, Marc Boroditsky, our new President of Revenue, has dug into \\nretooling our go to market efforts and identified significant opportunities to improve the efficiency and performance \\nof our sales team. Although we\\'ve won a third of the Fortune 500 cu stomers, if we\\'re honest with ourselves, we \\nsaw a lot of our success with our enterprise customers because our products were so good and solved the real \\nproblem that everyday company faces. That allowed many on our sales team to succeed largely by just tak ing \\norders. When the fish are jumping right in the boat, you don\\'t need to be a very good fisherman. But at the risk of \\nmixing watery metaphors, as the tide goes out, you get a clear view who\\'s not wearing shorts. The \\nmacroeconomic environment has gotten h arder, and we\\'re seeing that some on our team aren\\'t dressed for work.  \\n \\nDigging in with Marc, we\\'ve identified more than 100 people on our sales team who have consistently missed \\nexpectations. Simply put, a significant percentage of our salesforce has been  repeatedly underperforming based \\non measurable performance targets and critical KPIs. That\\'s obviously a problem, but it\\'s one in this environment \\nwith a particularly available and actionable solution. We are now in the process of quickly rotating out tho se \\nmembers of our team who have been underperforming and bringing in new talent, where the salespeople have a \\nproven track record of success, grit, and a strong cultural fit.  \\n \\nTo give you some sense, these 100 -plus people contributed approximately 4% of an nualized new business sold \\nover the last year. So we\\'re optimistic we can make this team upgrade without significantly impacting sales \\ncapacity.  \\n \\nWhile team upgrades are always hard, this is a uniquely good time for us to do this. A year ago, the tech labo r \\nmarket was extremely tight. Today, there is an abundance of talent eager to work at Cloudflare. In Q1, we \\nreceived more than 0.25 million applicants, approximately 40% of which were for sales positions. That\\'s more \\napplications than we received in all of  2021. In addition to the volume, the caliber of the applicants we\\'re receiving \\nis higher than we\\'ve seen at any point in our history, especially for go to market positions. While other companies \\nare laying off, we\\'re going to be bringing on great people w ith proven track records to raise the capability of our \\nenterprise go -to-market team.  \\n \\nWe\\'ve always had a culture of high performance at Cloudflare. However, with the value of hindsight, I think we \\nand most other businesses got a bit soft during the COVID crisis around performance management. That was \\nunderstandable at the time, but that time is over. The work we do is vitally important for the healthy functioning of \\nthe Internet.  \\n \\nThe opportunity ahead of us is massive. We have amazing people on our team w ho are executing every day to \\nrealize that opportunity, and we have an incredibly long line of other proven, talented people looking to step in to Cloudflare, Inc.  (NET) \\nQ1 2023 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \\n27-Apr-2023   \\n \\n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   5 \\nCopyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \\n \\nfill the position where some of our current team aren\\'t living up to expectations. Our pace of innovation is not \\nslowing down. Now, more than ever, it\\'s paramount. We continue to innovate and develop unique offerings that \\ndeliver value to our customers and differentiate us from the competition. We are great at that.  \\n \\nI want every dollar we put into Cloudflare to be more productive at driving revenue, profit and shareholder value. \\nInnovation is [indiscernible] (00:09:44) so even more productively, profitably and predictably than before. While \\nI\\'ve talked about our team that\\'s underperforming, that\\'s only half the s tory. \\n \\nOur top salespeople are terrific. On average, the top 15% of our sellers have achieved 129% of quota over the \\nlast four quarters. They\\'re incredibly consistent at bringing in new logos, expanding current customers and \\ndelivering results and approxim ately 27% of them started within the last 18 months. We know that if we hire the \\nright people, they can ramp quickly and be successful with a full bag of products we handle.  \\n \\nIn that spirit, let me tell you about some of the deals our top performers closed  this quarter. A Fortune 500 media \\ncompany expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three -year, $840,000 deal and bringing their total \\nannual spend to $2.1 million. A customer of our application, performance and security services since 2017, this \\ncompany expanded into our Zero Trust portfolio with access and browser isolation for thousands of its \\ncontractors, displacing two zero trust competitors and even turning down three licenses from one of them.  \\n \\nCloudflare\\'s products not only performed b etter than the competition during evaluation but we were the only \\ncompany that could deliver on the complex requirements needed. This contract is only the tip of the iceberg with \\nthe customer, which plans to potentially roll zero trust out to all their ten s of thousands of employees.  \\n \\nResponding to our Descaler campaign, a leading e -commerce technology company in Europe expanded their \\nrelationship with Cloudflare, signing a three -year $780,000 deal. The company is going all in on Cloudflare One, \\nGateway, Ac cess, CASB, DLP and Magic WAN. They were drawn to Cloudflare\\'s platform as a unified pane of \\nglass to consolidate their security modernization and network transformation needs with Magic WAN as a key \\ncompetitive differentiator versus first generation zero trust competitors.  \\n \\nA global industrial machinery manufacturer expanded their relationship with us by signing a three -year $648,000 \\ndeal. The company was looking to modernize their security infrastructure and is also going all -in on Cloudflare \\nOne with Access, Gateway, Area 1 and Magic WAN, displacing multiple competitors. They appreciate being able \\nto consolidate vendors, reduce costs, and increase flexibility with Cloudflare\\'s platform.  \\n \\nA Fortune 1000 SaaS company expanded their relationship with Clou dflare signing a three -year $8.4 million deal. \\nThe company recognized Cloudflare\\'s unique position as a neutral super cloud to manage and strengthen their \\napplication security posture and accelerated SaaS platform performance across AWS, GCP and their priv ate data \\ncenter environments. Additionally, no other solution could compete with our data localization suite to simplify the \\ncustomer\\'s global regulatory and compliance requirements.  \\n \\nA leading IoT security company expanded their relationship with us signi ng two three -year deals for a combined \\n$4.2 million, one for its commercial business and a FedRAMP one for its government business. The company has \\nbeen a Cloudflare customer since 2020, using core application services and Cloudflare Tunnel for IoT devices . \\nDrawn to our pace of innovation, this customer bought into the Cloudflare Platform Vision, now using over 25 \\nproducts across core application services, Zero Trust and our developer platform, including R2, our object store \\nand durable objects to combat hi gh egress fees from AWS. They plan to use Cloudflare\\'s FedRAMP authorization \\nto scale operations on both commercial and federal sides of their business and increase their security posture.  \\n Cloudflare, Inc.

They also added R2. The company has been dissatisfied with the unpredictability \\nof their build and bought -related issues from the current vendor and wanted to switch to Cloudflare,  knowing our \\nuniversal approach to protecting all traffic and our platforms ease of use we\\'re top of the industry.  \\n \\nA leading gaming company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, moving from a pay -as-you-go customer \\nspending $200 a month to a contra cted customer signing a one -year $388,000 deal for R2, Workers, and \\nApplication Services. The company was looking for a more scalable platform for storage and outperformance that \\nwould support their exponential growth because they realized that by moving t o R2, they could eliminate egress \\nfees they were incurring from the competitor, easily integrate with S3 APIs and centralized management. In \\nparticular, they were impressed with R2\\'s lower latency and better throughput, as well as how R2 tightly integrates  \\nwith Workers and our core Application Services.  \\n \\nTraction among developers continues to be strong. We now have 4.92 million Workers applications running on \\nour platform, up 146% over the last six months. 33,000 paying customers have activated R2, and are storing \\nmore than 7 petabytes of data, up 25% quarter -over-quarter. AI companies, large and small, continue to build on \\nCloudflare at a breakneck pace. When we asked them why, they said our neutral position, rapid innovation, and \\nmodern nimble development environment. One, last month, called us, \"the first cloud infrastructure company built \\nfor the age of AI\". I like the ring of that. And I\\'m extremely excited about our upcoming announcement at \\nDeveloper Week next month. We\\'ll announce a lot around how we s upport AI and make any developer more \\nproductive. We are the best in the industry at innovation, and we\\'re making the changes we need to make in \\ninvesting in our team to be the best [indiscernible] (00:15:50).  \\n \\nAs I step back and think about what was a cha llenging quarter, I\\'m struck by our opportunity. We are not limited \\nby the market for our products. We are not limited by innovation. We are not limited by pipeline opportunity. We \\nare not limited by our ability to recruit, and we are not even limited by s ales capacity. Instead, we are limited by \\nour go -to-market performance. That\\'s something we can fix. And we are committed to turning the current \\nmacroeconomic headwinds into a catalyst for positive change and growth at Cloudflare by investing in our top \\ntalent, refocusing on performance management, and elevating the productivity of our team to seize the \\nopportunity we have ahead, which we all know is massive.  \\n \\nWith that, I\\'ll turn it over to Thomas to walk through the financials. Thomas, take it away.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Josef Seifert  \\nChief Financial Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  \\nThank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. In the first quarter, we continue to witness the \\nchallenging business environment, which deteriorated significantly in March when negative headlines emerged \\nrelated to the SVB, the broadening banking crisis and the worsening macroeconomic outlook. With intensifying \\nbusiness uncertainty, companies became increasingly cautious in more deeply scrutinized deals which impacted \\nnumerous ar eas of our business, including a mature lengthening of sales cycles, delays in collections, and a \\nsignificant backend weighting in the linearity for the quarter.  \\n \\nFor some further context, technology, e -commerce and financial services, our largest end cust omer verticals by \\nrevenue. Also, this happens to revenue growth that impacted Cloudflare outside of our control. We remain \\ncommitted to controlling what we can control, and that is to focus on building great products that customers need \\nwhile also maintain ing our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible, and remain good stewards of \\ninvestors\\' capital. As such, we delivered a record quarter in terms of operating profit and operating margin, and Cloudflare, Inc.

We also con tinue to prudently allocate capital, with a focus on \\nmaximizing shareholder value.  \\n \\nTurning to revenue. Total revenue for the third (sic) [first] (00:18:05) quarter increased 37% year -over-year to \\n$290.2 million. New pipeline growth again remained strong i n the first quarter, exceeding our internal plan for the \\nsecond consecutive quarter, and continuing the trend of accelerating growth and new pipeline generation for a \\nthird consecutive quarter. However, the significant incremental caution exhibited by cust omers resulted in a \\npronounced decline in our close rate and an extreme backend  weighting of ACB bookings during the first quarter, \\nboth of which were primarily impacted by the aforementioned longer sales cycles.  \\n \\nMore specifically, our average sales cycl e during the first quarter was 27% longer than the average of the \\nprevious four quarters. Sales cycles increased most significantly in expansion deals with our contracted \\ncustomers, which were 49% longer than the average of the previous four quarters. Howe ver, our win rate against \\nthe competition remain high.  \\n \\nFrom a geographic perspective, the US represented 53% of revenue, an increase of 37% year -over-year. EMEA \\nrepresented 27% of revenue, an increase of 40% year -over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue , an \\nincrease of 31% year -over-year.  \\n \\nTurning to our customer metrics. In the first quarter, we had 168,159 paying customers, representing an increase \\nof 13% year -over-year. Turning to large customers, we ended the quarter with 2,156 large customers, \\nrepre senting an increase of 40% year -over-year and an addition of 114 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar -\\nbased net retention rate was 117% during the first quarter, representing a decrease of 500 basis points \\nsequentially and a decrease of 10 percentage  points year -over-year.  \\n \\nWe have not experienced elevated churn rate as renewal rates in the first quarter were consistent with the level of \\nexperience on average over the previous fourth quarter, which was an all -time high for the company. Instead, \\nsimila r to the fourth quarter of last year, the decline in DNR was again primarily driven by delayed expansion with \\nour larger customers.  \\n \\nMoving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 77.8%, representing an increase of 40 basis points \\nsequentially and a decrease of 90 basis points year -over-year. Network CapEx represented 5% of revenue in the \\nfirst quarter. For fiscal 2023, we continue to expect network CapEx to be 11% to 13% of revenue.  \\n \\nTurning to operating expenses. We understand that the crucial asp ect of our success is our commitment to being \\nresponsive to near -term changes in market conditions [indiscernible] (00:21:11) our operations accordingly, \\nwithout compromising the long -term opportunity ahead of us, which we all know is massive. We again too k \\n[indiscernible] (00:21:20) measures during the first quarter to improve operational efficiency and effectively \\nmanage spending. As a result of these actions, first quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue \\nremained consistent sequentially, an d decreased 5% year -over-year to 71%. Our total number of employees \\nincreased 23% year -over-year, bringing our total head count to approximately 3,390 at the end of the quarter. We \\nwill continue to pace hiring for the year based on market conditions.  \\n \\nSales and marketing expenses were $120.6 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of \\nrevenue increased by 1% sequentially, and remained consistent at 42%, compared to the same quarter last year. \\nResearch and development expenses were $51.3 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue \\nremained consistent sequentially, and decreased to 18% from 19% in the same quarter last year. General and Cloudflare, Inc.

G&A as a percentage of revenue rema ined consistent \\nsequentially, and decreased to 12% from 15% in the same quarter last year.  \\n \\nOperating income was $19.4 million, compared to an operating income of $4.9 million in the same period last \\nyear. First quarter operating margin was 6.7%, an increase of 440 basis points year -over-year. These results \\nhighlight the efficiency and elasticity of our business model, which remain key elements of Cloudflare success.  \\n \\nTurning to net income in the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $27.2 million, or a diluted net \\nincome per share of $0.08. During the first quarter, we initiated tax planning strategies and we were able to \\nsuccessfully reduce cash taxes related to bid and other taxes. As a result, tax expense for the quarter was $3.9 \\nmillion . We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale security. Free \\ncash flow was $13.9 million for the first quarter, or 5% of revenue, compared to negative $64.4 million, or 30% of \\nrevenue, in the same period la st year. Remaining performance applications or RPO came in $959 million, \\nrepresenting an increase of 6% sequentially and 39% year -over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO.  \\n \\nBefore moving to guidance for the second quarter and full year, I would like to begin with our expectations and the \\nprovisions we have factored into guidance. Last quarter, we highlighted our expectation for sales cycles to \\ncontinue to lengthen for both the first quarter and full year 2023. However, the level of elongation experienced  in \\nthe first quarter was unprecedented and far surpassed our forecast entering the year pressuring revenue growth. \\nAs a result, for the second quarter, despite the continued reacceleration of our new pipeline generation and our \\nhigh win rates against the competition, we presume sales cycle to remain at the elevated levels experienced \\nduring the first quarter and has therefore also assumed close rates remain at continued low levels.  \\n \\nFrom a linearity perspective, we have assumed a continued backend weightin g of ACV booked, and have \\ntherefore incorporated minimal in period revenue recognition for the second quarter. Also, we believe that \\ncurrently depressed close rates and elongated sales cycles are temporary in nature. We cannot predict when the \\nincreasing c aution is exhibited by the customers during the first quarter will recover. As such, we have assumed \\nthese headwinds, which intensified in the month of March, will persist through the end of the fiscal year.  \\n \\nNow, turning to guidance. For the second quarte r, we expect revenue in the range of $305 million to $306 million, \\nrepresenting an increase of 30% year -over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $14 million to $15 \\nmillion. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.07 to $0.08, assuming app roximately 345 million common \\nshares outstanding. Due to our aforementioned tax planning strategies, we expect an effective tax rate of 6%.  \\n \\nFor the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.284 billion, representing an increase  \\nof 31% year -over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $73 million to \\n$77 million. And we expect diluted net income per share over that period in the range of $0.34 to $0.35, assuming \\napproximately 345 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 9% for 2023.  \\n \\nAfter having achieved positive free cash flow in the second half of last year and again during the first quarter of \\nthis year, we continue to anticipate being free cash flow positi ve for the full year 2023. For modeling purposes, we \\nexpect free cash flow to trend upward on an ongoing basis, but anticipate near -term variability in our free cash \\nflow generation, with the second quarter anticipated to be lower than the first quarter du e to the timing of capital \\nexpenditures and other payable.  \\n \\nIn closing, we remain confident in the enormous opportunity ahead of us, as well as the elasticity and durability of \\nour operating model. We are focused on becoming more efficient, more productive , not just during the current Cloudflare, Inc.

Operator, please poll for questions.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\n \\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION  \\n  \\nOperator : Thank you, Mr. Seifert. [Operator Instructions] We\\'ll go first this afternoon to Sterling Auty of \\nMoffettNathanson.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nSterling Auty  \\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson LLC  Q \\nYeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I think the big question is around the guidance. I think coming out of last quarter, the \\nperception was that the guidance was actually aggressive and you kind of alluded to the close ra tes that you had \\nfactored in. Now, with the changes that you\\'ve seen, and especially in light of the sales changes you\\'re looking to \\nmake, what are the elements that investors can look to see the confidence in being able to deliver on the revised \\noutlook?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Josef Seifert  \\nChief Financial Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nYeah. Maybe I\\'d get started here. Remember when we gave guidance during the last quarter, we actually said the \\nfirst and second quarter are more challenging than the later half of the year . We looked at close rates and \\nassumed that what we have seen in the third and fourth quarter of last year of elongation would continue. But the \\ndeteriorating environment for prices, we saw sales cycles really elongate far beyond our forecast, up to 27% on  \\naverage, and then the expansion business was essentially for close to 50%. So, those were material differences \\nin the assumptions we had at the beginning of this year. I think we took this into account and adjusted guidance \\nnow carefully, also assuming th at the linearity deterioration we have seen in the first quarter would continue for \\nthe second quarter specifically. We have assumed hardly any revenue recognition from in -quarter ACV \\ngeneration. So, this, I think, is prudent in light of what we have seen.  You heard from Matthew that the sales \\npeople that are impacted by this measure contributed very little in terms of overall ACV generation to the current \\nresults. So, we think there is more upside in this transition than there is downside in terms of perfo rmance and \\npositive impact on sales capacity moving forward.  \\n \\nThe good thing to point out, however, is again, that the improvement in pipeline that we have now seen over \\nconsecutive quarters has continued in the first quarter. So, as Matthew mentioned, [in discernible] (00:30:32) the \\nlimitation of opportunity we will see in sales cycles extend, but not pipeline slowing down. So, that was a very \\nencouraging sign. But I think the results are prudently now reflected in the guidance and the deterioration we\\'ve \\nseen in the first quarter, especially from a cell cycle perspective, had a material impact on how we think about the \\nrest of the year.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nSterling Auty  \\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson LLC  Q \\nUnderstood. And maybe one quick follow -up for Matthew. Can you just characterize for us the traction and the AI \\nopportunity in particular? You gave us one example, but when you look at it as a whole, how are you seeing it Cloudflare, Inc.  (NET) \\nQ1 2023 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \\n27-Apr-2023   \\n \\n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   10 \\nCopyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \\n \\ntrack and what should we think about the expansion opportunities from that customer base through the r est of the \\nyear?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nYeah. Sterling, the AI [indiscernible] (00:31:20) I think surprised us last quarter in terms of the positive impact and \\nit continues to surprise us. We\\'ve  seen the revenue that\\'s coming from AI companies just quarter -over-quarter \\nhave had substantial growth north of 20% quarter -over-quarter growth from the largest AI companies that use us, \\nand it\\'s not just one or two but from large to small. What we\\'re hea ring from AI companies is that as they look to \\nwho they\\'re going to use for their infrastructure and they can start with a clean slate, the Cloudflare is a part of \\nthat, and that we\\'re helping them go fast, compete, get the most efficiency, be able to prot ect themselves from \\nsome of the significant cybersecurity and fraud risks that they face, and that continues to be something that is \\ndelivering really positive results for us. I think you\\'re going to see us during our Developer Week next month in \\nMay highl ight some of these customers\\' stories and highlight ways that AI companies are using Cloudflare in \\norder to push that innovation forward. So, I think that has continued to be a real positive for us and that has only \\naccelerated from even Q4.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nSterling Aut y \\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson LLC  Q \\nGreat. Thank you.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\n \\nOperator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\\'ll go next now to Thomas Blakely (sic) [Blakey] (00:33:07) of \\nKeyBanc.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Blakey  \\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.  Q \\nHey, guys. Tom Blakey with KeyBanc. Thanks for taking the question here. It sounds like there\\'s a lot of pent -up \\ndemand, no gross churn, and pipeline making new records. Maybe this is for Matthew. You talked about it. These \\nare critical needs in terms of access and security, no t so much nice to have. What are these customers explaining \\nto you that they\\'re waiting on, maybe looking for some indicators in terms of like how long this pause will kind of \\ntake a thought, Matthew? That would be my first question.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChair man, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nYeah. I think that everyone continues to communicate to us that they want to continue to invest with us. I think \\nwhat we\\'re seeing from IT organization is that they\\'re all looking very critical ly at their budgets and asking \\nthemselves what projects can they delay versus what projects do they have to invest in? So, we continue to see \\nwhen companies are under duress, when they\\'re under attack, that those deals are closing extremely quickly. But \\nsome of the times where people are initiating a new large project around moving to a Zero Trust environment or \\nsomething else that would be a larger initiative that the sales cycles on those projects are extending beyond \\nwhere they were before. I think one o f the things that\\'s unique about Cloudflare is even with the extended sales \\ncycles, our sales cycles tend to, on average, be significantly faster than the peers in our industry. And so, back in \\nearly 2022, we were among the first to call the slowdown in th e economy because we could see that sales cycle \\nslowed down. They picked back up. But then, again, are slowing down right now. I think we tend to see that \\nearlier than some of our peers.  \\n Cloudflare, Inc.  (NET) \\nQ1 2023 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \\n27-Apr-2023   \\n \\n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   11 \\nCopyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \\n \\nAnd I think that one of the things that has always characterized how  we think about our business is real prudence \\nas we look forward. So, no one is telling us that projects are getting cancelled in any significant way. But people \\nare saying, budgets are tight, we\\'re being more cautious. And that is taking our sales cycles to be longer than we \\nhave historically seen, and longer even than the elevation that we saw through the back half of 2022. So, we\\'re \\ntrying to be very prudent about how we think about this, but customers continue to tell us, they\\'re not switching to \\nanothe r competitor. They\\'re not – we haven\\'t seen any elevation in loss rates to the competition. Quite the \\nopposite. And people are saying, we want to invest with you. We\\'re just being cautious with our IT spend, and \\nthat\\'s causing everyone to measure twice bef ore they cut one.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Blakey  \\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.  Q \\nRight. That\\'s helpful, Matt. And maybe as a follow -up, perfect segue actually to the conservativeness of this guide. \\nIt sounds like it\\'s increasingly conservative [indiscernible] (00:36:31) Thomas, in terms of maybe any indications of \\nwhat he\\'s seeing from numbers coming in in April, a month from the end of March, and just kind of trying to gauge \\nin terms of when we could even get back to this 130% long -term [indiscernible] (00:36: 49) would be helpful \\n[indiscernible] (00:36:51).  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Josef Seifert  \\nChief Financial Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nThe early indication on the second quarter do not indicate a material change, neither to the negative nor to the \\npositive. So, we are cruis ing along, but no indication that it gets materially better. But as I said, no indications that \\nit\\'s deteriorating either.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Blakey  \\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.

We\\'ll go next now to Brent Thill at Jefferies.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nBrent Thill  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nGood afternoon. Matthew, just on the sales side, when you think about what\\'s happening with the new Head of \\nRevenue and ultimately kind of what happens when you change out – I mean, I guess, how confide nt are you that \\nthere isn\\'t a longer transition on the existing team? What\\'s giving you that view that this current team\\'s kind of in \\nplace, you\\'ve got the right fit, and this is maybe more internal execution than external forces?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman , Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nWell, I think it\\'s a combination of both of those things, if we\\'re honest. I think that the fact that the macro economy \\nhas gotten harder, exposed some of the weaknesses in some of the sellers on our team when things were \\ncruising along in 2021, again, you don\\'t have to be a really disciplined seller in order to be successful at \\nCloudflare. And I think that that, combined with some of what happened during COVID, combined with our \\nhesitancy in terms  of what the opportunity costs were in terms of replacing people when the tech employment \\nmarket was overheating, all combined to have us get to a place where we just had a number of people on our \\nteam who weren\\'t performing.  \\n Cloudflare, Inc.  (NET) \\nQ1 2023 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \\n27-Apr-2023   \\n \\n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   12 \\nCopyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \\n \\nAnd I think Marc has done an incredible job at really identifying specifically who those people are and starting the \\nprocess of moving those people off. What I see, though, is that if you look at our top sellers, they are enjoying \\nincredible success, and where the lowest performing se llers decelerated substantially during the macroeconomic \\nslowdown are the top sellers on our team have seen around a 1% decrease in their productivity. And so, what that \\nindicates to me is that with new leaders like Marc, the incredible talent which is app lying to Cloudflare again, a \\nquarter million people applied to work for us in Q1. I don\\'t know of any other SaaS company that is seeing that \\nvolume of talent that is out there. People want to come work for us. The people who are successful at Cloudflare \\ncan be extremely productive and can do well themselves as sellers. And I think Marc is bringing a focus and a \\ndiscipline which is going to pay off. And the thing that\\'s, I think, very encouraging is as we look at the people that \\nwe can replace, that they are  contributing such a small percentage in terms of our capacity that we actually think \\nthat this will – any type of change like this, obviously, is something that we want to do very humanely. And we \\nwant to be very thoughtful about taking care of the team t hat we have.  \\n \\nBut we think that as we transition that team out, we\\'re going to not only increase the performance of our high \\nperformers, but bring on new performers that give us much higher performing capacity. And Marc, I think, is doing \\nan incredible job  at not only identifying who has to be moved out, but, boy, when I talk to the people that we\\'re \\nhiring to replace those people, I just get incredibly excited by what they\\'re able to deliver to us.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nBrent Thill  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nAnd just a quick follow -up for Thomas. It looks like, if I\\'m looking at this right, the number of net new enterprise \\naccounts was the lowest you\\'ve seen in two years at 114 sequentially. So, I guess, it seems like you saw it across \\nboth Enterprise and SMB is kind of the wa y to frame it, that you didn\\'t – there wasn\\'t one sector that stayed \\nstronger.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Josef Seifert  \\nChief Financial Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nI think that read is correct.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nBrent Thill  \\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC  Q \\nGreat. Thank you.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\n \\nOperator : Thank you.

Is that being impacted by macros sort of more or less the same as the \\nEnterprise?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nI think that what we\\'re seeing is, again, weakness across the entire space. Pay -as-you-go, remember, is a \\nrelatively small percentage of our overall business, less than 15% of revenue. So, it doesn\\'t move the needle one \\ndirection or another. But we definitely are seeing that there is a lower rate of upgrade. But at the same time, we Cloudflare, Inc.  (NET) \\nQ1 2023 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \\n27-Apr-2023   \\n \\n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   13 \\nCopyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \\n \\nare not s eeing that there is a lower rate of downgrade. What I am excited by is the developer traction that we\\'re \\nseeing across our business. The fact that we\\'re closing in on 5 million applications running across the platform, \\nthe majority of those are coming from  pay-as-you-go developers. And that continues to be a pipeline where we \\nsee lots of success.  \\n \\nWe also have examples like the one that\\'s cited in the prepared remarks where we had a customer that was \\npaying us $200 a month that, that we identify, worked with, and were able to upgrade to a enterprise customer \\nspending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year with us. So, pay -as-you-go continues to pay lots of dividends, \\nbut I think that the same conservativeness where people are just watching their budgets much more carefully \\nshows up across the entire space, and we don\\'t see a significant difference at the low end of our business versus \\nthe high end of the business.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Hedberg  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nGot it. Thanks. And then, Thomas, with  the reduced 2023 outlook, 31.5%, I think in the midpoint. That\\'s below sort \\nof the implied five -year $5 billion target that you guys talked about a couple of quarters ago. Just any thoughts on \\n[indiscernible] (00:44:08) environment change, your thought pr ocess on getting to that $5 billion in five years or \\nmaybe just some updated thoughts on that.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Josef Seifert  \\nChief Financial Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nYeah. As Matthew rightfully pointed out, the market is not limiting. It\\'s limiting – and the opportunity is not limiting \\nus. There are some headwinds now. They will be temporary in nature, but they don\\'t take away from the \\nenormous opportunity that is in front of us. So, it doesn\\'t change our thinking around where this journey is going to \\ntake us.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Hedberg  \\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \\nThank you very much.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\n \\nOperator : Thank you. We\\'ll go next now to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nKeith Weiss  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nExcellent, guys. Thank you, guys, for, for taking the  question. I [indiscernible] (00:44:58) a little dense here, but \\nI\\'m not quite getting what happened in the quarter. When I think through like some of the explanations that you \\nguys are giving, the banking crisis was in the, I think, the first two weeks of  March. You guys tend to have a pretty \\nlinear business. So like I would have expected the comment to be we only closed like 15% of our business in the \\nlast two weeks, if that was what the impact was.  \\n \\nAnd then like with the salespeople, if they hadn\\'t been  productive for a while, there\\'s nothing really incremental \\nthere. And you guys have been, like, and Matthew, you called out a weaker macro last year, and you\\'re one of the \\nearlier ones that said, hey, listen, it isn\\'t a great environment out there, but yo u guys were able to operate really \\neffectively all throughout 2022, and you bring to market a really good ROI focus and really good cost, like value \\nproposition. Like, I don\\'t quite get what changed in Q1 in the timeframe in which it changed.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

A \\nYeah. Keith, I think that as we\\'ve put a floodlight on it, the biggest thing that changes sales cycle [indiscernible] \\n(00:46:02) more than 25%. And so that pushed back a lot of what was happening in the quarter. We would \\ntypically see about half of our business closed in the last month of the quarter. I think the fact that you had the \\nuncertainty around the banks, and again it wasn\\'t just customers of SVB or Credit Suisse, but it was entire space \\nspaces, where purchasing departments really said that, I mean, they got very nervous regardless of who they \\nwere banking with. And we just saw more companies push pause on that. That pushed a lot of our business into \\nthe last half of March. An d it pushed some of our business outside of closing within in the quarter. And so what we \\ndon\\'t know is whether March is the new reality, in which case, again I think we want to be very prudent as how we \\nthink about the business going forward or if the wor ld will snap back fairly quickly.  \\n \\nThe early reads that we\\'re seeing are not that where, again, it doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s getting significantly worse, but \\nwe don\\'t also see things getting significantly better. But that again, as we sort of shone a floodlig ht on, what was it \\nthat changed? What changed is a material change in the length of the sales cycles – the win rates didn\\'t change \\nbut the close rate s did.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nKeith Weiss  \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \\nYou guys mentioned that you saw that in both sma ll customers and large customers. Were there any product \\nfamilies that sustained better or worse than others? Was there any variance on that side of the equation?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nNo. I th ink we continue to have extremely fast close rate when someone is under duress. So when they see that \\nthere is a problem and they need to and they need to address it, I think and that doesn\\'t change quarter -over-\\nquarter for I think obvious reasons. We\\'re a ble to respond very quickly. And if someone\\'s offline, we bring them \\nback online. And those deals close in often a matter of hours.  \\n \\nThe things that – other things that showed a lot of promise in the quarter were things like R2 where we\\'re \\nincreasingly seeing large customers bring over larger and larger datasets. But across the board, we were seeing \\nthat anything that required sort of a larger IT commitment, customers were again measuring twice before they cut \\none. And there was a material increase in sa les cycles.  \\n \\nWhat I think is different about us and a lot of other companies is that we see things faster because even with the \\n25% increase in sales cycle, we\\'re still significantly faster sales cycles than most other companies. And so I think \\nwe see thin gs earlier. And what we don\\'t know, again, is that there a radical change to how procurement \\ndepartments are thinking about IT spending. That is what we are trying to be prudent around when we think about \\nguidance. Or is it something that was just a short -term effect of sort of the anxiety in March around the banking \\nsector. And I think that the next quarter will prove out which direction that goes, but we want to be extremely \\nprudent and cautious as we think about things going forward.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nKeith Weiss  \\nAnalys t, Morgan Stanley & Co.

We go next now to James Fish at Piper Sandler.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nJames E. Fish  \\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler & Co.  Q \\nHey, guys. Gross margins here are holding above your long -term average as well. And, Matt, you actually just \\ntalked about the fact that these larger commitments are taking longer. Is there a thought process here to maybe \\njust try to get that land a little bit smaller and maybe offer discou nts kind of near term to try to land smaller deals \\nhere?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nI think that\\'s always been part of our playbook. And I think that what we are able to do because of the broad set of \\nproducts that we have is find lots of different ways into a customer\\'s account. And so that\\'s something that we\\'re \\nable to do. And I think we can maintain gross margins that we\\'re are within our 75% to 77% target range. I think \\nit\\'s a mistake for us to dramatically take gross margin rate down over time. But I think that we can actually bundle \\nand discount and go after even small deals because of the margin profiles that we have and then use the \\nengineering that we have in order to deliver, still the gros s margins that we expect.  \\n \\nSo we\\'re not changing what our gross margin targets are. We are not losing deals on price. And we\\'re been able \\nto continue to be extremely competitive and deliver an extremely high ROI, while also delivering software gross \\nmargin s. \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nJames E. Fish  \\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler & Co.  Q \\nMakes sense. And, Thomas, appreciate all the details around sales cycle lengthening. But on the closed rates, is \\nthere a way to think about the magnitude difference you\\'re seeing here? And how much worse c ould it get for you \\nguys? Is this kind of the bottom potentially a close race that you\\'re assuming or could it get another step lower \\nfrom here? Thanks, guys.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Josef Seifert  \\nChief Financial Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nWe always say we are prudent about when we talk about our guidance. I think we try to be prudent for this \\nquarter. We try to take into account what we have seen in the first quarter and we\\'re thoughtful around how we \\nbuilt improvement or non -improvement in those variables. And so the non-linearity we saw in the quarter was \\nsignificant. We have not incorporated any significant improvement. As I said in this quarter, the second quarter, \\nwe have not assumed any significant revenue recognition from ACV during the second quarter. So I think  we\\'ve \\nbeen thoughtful about how we have looked at the outlook.  \\n \\nYou know what, I just want to reiterate what Matthew said. When you started this year, we sort of thought from \\nour perspective at that point, we said there is the guidance for the first quart er especially, it is probably more \\nchallenging than for the remainder of the year, and that\\'s I think how we framed it.  \\n \\nIf you look at the first quarter, we came into range of our guidance slightly off the midpoint in in primarily because \\nof the non -linea rity of the first quarter. What impacted the forward -looking guidance is that elongation of sales \\ncycles. And that is so you push a wave of ACV further out and we looked at that wave and we have not assumed \\nthat it\\'s going to pull in significantly over the  course of the year. So I think we have been thoughtful about how we \\nput the guidance together.  Cloudflare, Inc.

We go next now to Joel Fishbein with Truist.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nJoel P. Fishbein  \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.  Q \\nThanks for taking my questions. And, M atthew, just one for you and really appreciate the color on the changes \\nyou\\'re making in go to market efficiency. But I wanted to ask about some of the partnerships that you\\'ve \\nestablished with some of the global sites like Accenture and Shields up and see  if you\\'ve seen any change in that \\ngo to market and maybe just give us an update on how those are factoring?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nI think that we\\'re still in the early days of that but encouraging We were able to win a federal deal which continues \\nto expand in partnership with Accenture. And that has given them confidence to take us to market in a number of \\nother partnership and global deals. I think that Marc has been great in terms of bringing real focus on partnerships \\nand thinking about what are the parts of the market that we want to serve directly versus what are the parts of the \\nmarket that we want to serve with partners.  \\n \\nAnd I think as we have these early wins, that begets our ab ility to win more with the large global systems \\nintegrators and other large partners. They\\'re seeing the same thing that we are when I talk to them. They\\'re \\nseeing very much a conservatism around IT spend that I think is less pronounced in the security spa ce. \\n \\nAnd so I think that there is more willingness and eagerness to work with us. But when we talk to the systems \\nintegrators and other large partners, especially at the high end of the market, I think that they are reflecting the \\nsame sort of conservatism  of measure multiple times before you cut that they\\'re seeing from their customers. And \\nI think that it continues to be a large opportunity and something that especially in Zero Trust in workers, we\\'re \\nseeing that we can deliver more with them. But I think  that that that is a place where we\\'ve actually seen IT shops \\nlook at ways of making sure that they\\'re being as optimal as possible.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nJoel P. Fishbein  \\nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.  Q \\nThanks. Just as a quick follow -up, are the deal sizes there generall y bigger than your normal size since you\\'re \\nlanding? It seems like to be larger organizations with – with these partners?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nYeah, they tend to be larger than the average deal. But we land $10 million -plus deals on our own as well. I think \\nover time you\\'ll see us again work more closely with those FIs and other partners to deliver some of the larger \\ndeals and make sure that we can make inroads into more accounts and use the m as a way to help integrate \\nlarger solutions together. So again, I think it\\'s something that is a priority for us. I think we have the early wins, but \\nnow we need to continue to scale those programs.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nJoel P.

We\\'ll take our final question today from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMark R. Murphy  \\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q \\nThank you very much. Thomas, were bookings more heavily impacted on the CDN side of the business or the \\nsecurity side or perhaps elsewhere?  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nThomas Josef Seifert  \\nChief Financial Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nWe never talk about CDN. I would say I come back to what Matthew said, if customers are in difficult situations \\nunder duress, we onb oard fast. Those products tend to be security products. And so if there\\'s a statement that all \\nproduct -wise is that security product suites are doing better statement than the application services.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMark R. Murphy  \\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q \\nOkay.  Understood. And then, Matthew, when you look back on it and I think Brent asked about this a bit earlier, \\nbut the change in Head of Sales position last November, the goal was to introduce more rigor and discipline. And \\nI think you acknowledged at the time  that that those changes can take time. I\\'m curious to what extent you might \\nhave actually seen disruptions from sales org changes, whether it be account mapping or territory assignments or \\ncommission structures or anything along those lines which, which y ou could look at and say, well, this might \\nactually stabilize a little later in the year.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMatthew Prince  \\nChairman, Co -Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Cloudflare, Inc.  A \\nY eah. I understand that that would be handy if we could point to that. I don\\'t think that that\\'s what we\\'re seeing \\nright now. I think that we have actually seen our top sellers be more productive. I think that the changes that Marc \\nis putting in place really, you know, are starting with these changes now. And that obviously does intr oduce \\nuncertainty. We think we have our handle around that. I think we\\'ve planned that extremely well. And again I think \\nthat as we look out at the caliber and quality of the people who we can bring on board and how we can invest in \\nour top performers toda y, just getting our sales performance to look much more like a normal distribution than \\nwhat today is much more of a bimodal distribution is an extremely effective way for us to reaccelerate the growth \\nthat we have.  \\n \\nAnd so the changes that Marc is making are the right changes. Our team, the highest performing individual \\ncontributors and managers on our team are leaning forward and emailing me every day about how great it is to \\nhave an additional amount of rigor and discipline, there may be bumps along the road, these transitions do take \\ntime, but I think we are on the right path. Marc is the right person across our team, the feedback that we\\'re getting \\nis extremely positive, and again we\\'re not limited by the market for our products. We\\'re not limited by in novation. \\nWe\\'re not limited by pipeline. We\\'re not even limited really by sales capacity even as we transition people off of \\nour team. And so that gives me a lot of confidence going forward that while we will continue to see pressure from \\nthe macroeconomic  conditions over the next year, I really am excited for as we have our sales engine match our \\ninnovation engine, what we\\'re going to be able to deliver as a company.  \\n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \\nMark R.
