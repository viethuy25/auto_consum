      "1. Organization\n",
      "Palantir Technologies Inc. (including its subsidiaries, “Palantir” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 6, 2003. The Company builds and\n",
      "deploys software platforms that serve as the central operating systems for its customers.\n",
      "2. Significant Accounting Policies\n",
      "Basis of Presentation and Consolidation\n",
      "The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted\n",
      "accounting principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial\n",
      "reporting. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palantir Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n",
      "All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company holds at least a 20%\n",
      "ownership interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but does not control, the investee are accounted for using the equity method of\n",
      "accounting. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues,\n",
      "income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), or cash flows. The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31.\n",
      "The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements\n",
      "as of that date, but does not include all disclosures, including certain notes required by GAAP on an annual reporting basis. In management’s opinion, the\n",
      "unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the balance sheets and statements of\n",
      "operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of\n",
      "operations to be anticipated for the full fiscal year or any future period.\n",
      "These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and\n",
      "notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023.\n",
      "Use of Estimates\n",
      "The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and\n",
      "assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated\n",
      "financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\n",
      "Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the identification\n",
      "of performance obligations in customer contracts; the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; the collectability of contract consideration,\n",
      "including accounts receivable; the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets; the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from business\n",
      "combinations, including intangible assets and goodwill; and the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases. Estimates and judgments are based on\n",
      "historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results\n",
      "could differ from those estimates and such differences could affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\n",
      "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n",
      "The Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in its\n",
      "Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023. There have been no significant\n",

      "Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n",
      "The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n",
      "Cash equivalents primarily consist of amounts invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities.\n",

      "Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\n",
      "Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company generally grants non-collateralized credit terms to\n",
      "its customers. Allowance for credit losses is based on the Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio and is\n",
      "determined based on expectations of the customer’s ability to pay by considering factors such as customer type (commercial or government), historical\n",
      "experience, financial position of the customer, age of the accounts receivable, current economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and\n",
      "reasonable and supportable forward-looking factors about its portfolio and future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written-off and charged against\n",

      "2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of $11.3 million and $10.1 million, respectively.\n",
      "Debt Securities\n",
      "Debt securities are primarily comprised of U.S. treasury securities. The debt securities are classified as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and are\n",
      "reevaluated as of each balance sheet date. The Company considers the majority of its available-for-sale debt securities as available for use in current operations\n",
      "and may sell these securities at any time, and therefore classifies these securities as current assets in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities\n",
      "included in marketable securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets consist of U.S. treasury securities with original maturities of greater than three\n",
      "months at the time of purchase, and the remaining U.S. treasury securities are included in cash and cash equivalents. Interest income on debt securities\n",
      "classified as available-for-sale is included in other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Non-marketable debt\n",
      "securities are recorded at their estimated fair value in other assets with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss, net on the\n",
      "condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n",
      "The majority of the Company’s available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period using quoted prices of similar instruments and are\n",
      "classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company evaluates investments with unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment by\n",
      "assessing if they are related to deterioration in credit risk and whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the Company’s intent\n",
      "to sell, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. Credit-related\n",
      "impairment losses, not to exceed the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, are recognized in other income (expense), net in the condensed\n",

      "determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n",
      "Concentrations of Credit Risk\n",
      "Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted\n",
      "cash, accounts receivable, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds and U.S. treasury securities with original\n",
      "maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted\n",
      "cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has\n",

      "Contract Liabilities\n",

      "liability balances were $427.9 million and $339.2 million, respectively. Revenue of $192.4 million and $187.0 million was recognized during the three months\n",
      "ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n",
      "Remaining Performance Obligations\n",
      "The Company’s arrangements with its customers often have terms that span over multiple years. However, the Company allows many of its customers to\n",
      "terminate contracts for convenience prior to the end of the stated term with less than twelve months’ notice. Revenue allocated to remaining performance\n",
      "obligations represents noncancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts\n",
      "that will be invoiced. The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts\n",
      "with original terms of twelve months or less. Cancelable contracted revenue, which includes customer deposits, is not considered a remaining performance\n",
      "obligation.\n",
      "The Company’s remaining performance obligations were $936.0 million as of March 31, 2023, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 57%\n",

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\n1. Organization\\nPalantir Technologies Inc. (including its subsidiaries, “Palantir” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 6, 2003. The Company builds and\\ndeploys software platforms that serve as the central operating systems for its customers.\\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted\\naccounting principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial\\nreporting. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palantir Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\\nAll significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company holds at least a 20%\\nownership interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but does not control, the investee are accounted for using the equity method of\\naccounting. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues,\\nincome (loss) from operations, net income (loss), or cash flows. The Company\\'s fiscal year ends on December 31.\\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements\\nas of that date, but does not include all disclosures, including certain notes required by GAAP on an annual reporting basis. In management’s opinion, the\\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the balance sheets and statements of\\noperations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of\\noperations to be anticipated for the full fiscal year or any future period.\\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\\'s audited consolidated financial statements and\\nnotes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and\\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated\\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\\nSignificant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the identification\\nof performance obligations in customer contracts; the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; the collectability of contract consideration,\\nincluding accounts receivable; the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets; the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from business\\ncombinations, including intangible assets and goodwill; and the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases. Estimates and judgments are based on\\nhistorical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results\\ncould differ from those estimates and such differences could affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in its\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023. There have been no significant\\nchanges to these policies during the three months ended March 31, 2023, except for the changes noted below.\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\\nCash equivalents primarily consist of amounts invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities.\\n8\\nTable of contents\\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\nRestricted cash primarily consists of cash and certificates of deposit that are held as collateral against letters of credit and guarantees that the Company is\\nrequired to maintain for operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements.\\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum\\nto the total of the amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\\nAs of March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n1,264,738 $\\n2,269,411 \\nRestricted cash\\n11,946 \\n33,804 \\nRestricted cash, noncurrent\\n12,095 \\n29,222 \\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\\n$\\n1,288,779 $\\n2,332,437 \\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company generally grants non-collateralized credit terms to\\nits customers. Allowance for credit losses is based on the Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio and is\\ndetermined based on expectations of the customer’s ability to pay by considering factors such as customer type (commercial or government), historical\\nexperience, financial position of the customer, age of the accounts receivable, current economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and\\nreasonable and supportable forward-looking factors about its portfolio and future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written-off and charged against\\nan allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. Based upon the Company’s assessment as of March 31,\\n2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of $11.3 million and $10.1 million, respectively.\\nDebt Securities\\nDebt securities are primarily comprised of U.S. treasury securities. The debt securities are classified as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and are\\nreevaluated as of each balance sheet date. The Company considers the majority of its available-for-sale debt securities as available for use in current operations\\nand may sell these securities at any time, and therefore classifies these securities as current assets in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities\\nincluded in marketable securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets consist of U.S. treasury securities with original maturities of greater than three\\nmonths at the time of purchase, and the remaining U.S. treasury securities are included in cash and cash equivalents. Interest income on debt securities\\nclassified as available-for-sale is included in other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Non-marketable debt\\nsecurities are recorded at their estimated fair value in other assets with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss, net on the\\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe majority of the Company’s available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period using quoted prices of similar instruments and are\\nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company evaluates investments with unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment by\\nassessing if they are related to deterioration in credit risk and whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the Company’s intent\\nto sell, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. Credit-related\\nimpairment losses, not to exceed the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, are recognized in other income (expense), net in the condensed\\nconsolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and non-credit related losses are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive\\nloss, net in the condensed consolidated balance sheets until realized. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are\\ndetermined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted\\ncash, accounts receivable, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds and U.S. treasury securities with original\\nmaturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted\\ncash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has\\nnot experienced any losses on such amounts.\\n9\\nTable of contents\\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\nThe Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The\\nCompany’s accounts receivable balances as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $254.0 million and $258.3 million, respectively. Customer I\\nrepresented 13% of total accounts receivable as of March 31, 2023 and no other customers represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of March\\n31, 2023. No customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022.\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, Customer K, which is in the government operating segment, represented 10% of total revenue and no other\\ncustomers represented more than 10% of total revenue for the same period. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, no customer represented 10% or more\\nof total revenue.\\n3. Contract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations\\nContract Liabilities\\nThe Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 the Company\\'s contract\\nliability balances were $427.9 million and $339.2 million, respectively. Revenue of $192.4 million and $187.0 million was recognized during the three months\\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nRemaining Performance Obligations\\nThe Company’s arrangements with its customers often have terms that span over multiple years. However, the Company allows many of its customers to\\nterminate contracts for convenience prior to the end of the stated term with less than twelve months’ notice. Revenue allocated to remaining performance\\nobligations represents noncancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts\\nthat will be invoiced. The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts\\nwith original terms of twelve months or less. Cancelable contracted revenue, which includes customer deposits, is not considered a remaining performance\\nobligation.\\nThe Company’s remaining performance obligations were $936.0 million as of March 31, 2023, of which the Company expects to recognize approximately 57%\\nas revenue over the next 12 months, 36% as revenue over the subsequent 13 to 36 months, and the remainder thereafter.\\nDisaggregation of Revenue\\nSee Note 12. Segment and Geographic Information for disaggregated revenue by customer segment and geographic region.\\n4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements\\nThe following tables present the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in\\nthousands):\\nAs of March 31, 2023\\nTotal\\nLevel 1\\nLevel 2\\nLevel 3\\nAssets:\\nCash and cash equivalents:\\nMoney market funds\\n$\\n467,469 $\\n467,469 $\\n— $\\n— \\nU.S. treasury securities\\n199,304 \\n— \\n199,304 \\n— \\nCertificates of deposit\\n6,174 \\n— \\n6,174 \\n— \\nRestricted cash, current and noncurrent:\\nCertificates of deposit\\n14,358 \\n— \\n14,358 \\n— \\nMarketable securities:\\nU.S. treasury securities\\n1,623,212 \\n— \\n1,623,212 \\n— \\nPublicly-traded equity securities\\n16,585 \\n16,585 \\n— \\n— \\nTotal\\n$\\n2,327,102 $\\n484,054 $\\n1,843,048 $\\n— \\n10\\nTable of contents\\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\nAs of December 31, 2022\\nTotal\\nLevel 1\\nLevel 2\\nLevel 3\\nAssets:\\nCash and cash equivalents:\\nMoney market funds\\n$\\n1,149,302 $\\n1,149,302 $\\n— $\\n— \\nCertificates of deposit\\n6,791 \\n— \\n6,791 \\n— \\nRestricted cash, current and noncurrent:\\nCertificates of deposit\\n18,707 \\n— \\n18,707 \\n— \\nMarketable securities:\\nPublicly-traded equity securities\\n35,135 \\n35,135 \\n— \\n— \\nTotal\\n$\\n1,209,935 $\\n1,184,437 $\\n25,498 $\\n— \\nCertificates of Deposit\\nThe Company’s certificates of deposit are Level 2 instruments. The fair value of such instruments is estimated based on valuations obtained from third-party\\npricing services that utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are\\nobservable either directly or indirectly. These inputs include interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\nDebt Securities\\nAs of March 31, 2023, debt securities consisted of the following (in thousands):\\nAs of March 31, 2023\\nAmortized Cost\\nUnrealized Gains\\nUnrealized Losses\\nFair Value\\nU.S. treasury securities\\n$\\n1,822,231 $\\n304 \\n$\\n(19)\\n$\\n1,822,516 \\nTotal debt securities\\n$\\n1,822,231 $\\n304 \\n$\\n(19)\\n$\\n1,822,516 \\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n199,260 $\\n44 \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n199,304 \\nIncluded in marketable securities\\n$\\n1,622,971 $\\n260 \\n$\\n(19)\\n$\\n1,623,212 \\nThe Company sold $694.6 million of debt securities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and immediately reinvested such proceeds into additional\\ndebt securities. The realized gains and losses from those sales were immaterial. No credit or non-credit losses related to debt securities were recorded as of\\nMarch 31, 2023. Available-for-sale debt securities of $369.8 million were in an unrealized loss position primarily due to unfavorable changes in interest rates\\nsubsequent to initial purchase. None of the available-for-sale debt securities held as of March 31, 2023 were in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater\\nthan 12 months. The decline in fair value below amortized cost basis was not considered other than temporary as it is more likely than not that the Company\\nwill hold the securities until maturity or a recovery of the cost basis, and no credit-related impairment losses were recorded as of March 31, 2023. All of the\\nCompany’s U.S. treasury securities had contractual maturities due within one year.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company held an immaterial amount of debt securities.\\nEquity Securities\\nEquity securities primarily consist of shares held in publicly-traded companies, which are recorded at fair market value each reporting period in marketable\\nsecurities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we have accepted, and may continue to accept, securities as noncash compensation.\\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three\\nmonths ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded net unrealized losses of $51.9 million and realized losses of $10.9 million within other income\\n(expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, net unrealized losses from\\npublicly-traded equity securities held at the end of each period were $8.2 million and $58.4 million, respectively.\\n11\\nTable of contents\\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\nInvestments\\nFrom 2021 through 2022, the Company approved and entered into certain agreements (“Investment Agreements”) to purchase shares of various entities,\\nincluding special purpose acquisition companies and/or other privately-held or publicly-traded entities (each, an “Investee,” and such purchases, the\\n“Investments”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased shares for a total investment of $124.5 million. No Investments were\\npurchased under such Investment Agreements during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\\nIn connection with signing the Investment Agreements, each Investee or an associated entity and the Company entered into a commercial contract for access to\\nthe Company’s products and services (collectively, the “Strategic Commercial Contracts”). The terms of such contracts, including contractual options, range\\nfrom two to seven years and are subject to termination for cause provisions.\\nThe Company assesses the concurrent agreements under the noncash consideration paid or payable to a customer guidance within Accounting Standards\\nCodification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as well as the commercial substance of each arrangement considering the customer’s ability and\\nintention to pay as well as the Company’s obligation to perform under each contract. As currently assessed, the total value of such Strategic Commercial\\nContracts with Investees or associated entities was $390.3 million as of March 31, 2023, which is inclusive of $43.7 million of contractual options. The\\nCompany performs ongoing assessments of customers’ financial condition, including the consideration of such customers’ ability and intention to pay, and\\nwhether all or some portion of the value of such contracts continue to meet the criteria for revenue recognition, among other factors. As of March 31, 2023, the\\ncumulative amount of revenue recognized from Strategic Commercial Contracts was $200.1 million, of which $33.4 million of revenue was recognized during\\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023.\\nAlternative Investments\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased $50.9 million in 100-ounce gold bars. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the\\nCompany sold all of its gold bars for total proceeds of $51.1 million and recorded an immaterial realized gain within other income (expense), net on the\\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\\n5.

Debt\\n2014 Credit Facility\\nIn October 2014, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility, which has been subsequently secured by substantially all of the Company’s\\nassets and amended from time to time (as amended, the “2014 Credit Facility”). As of March 31, 2023, the 2014 Credit Facility allows for the drawdown of up\\nto $950.0 million to fund working capital and general corporate expenditures, which includes total revolving commitments of $500.0 million and a delayed\\ndraw term loan (“DDTL”) commitment of $450.0 million, each with a maturity date of March 31, 2027. The DDTL commitment is available to draw upon\\nthrough July 1, 2023.\\nOutstanding balances under the 2014 Credit Facility would incur interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as administered by the Federal\\nReserve Bank of New York, or a successor administrator of the SOFR (or the applicable benchmark replacement), plus 2.00% or a base rate plus 1.00%,\\nsubject to certain adjustments. The Company incurs a commitment fee of 0.30% assessed on the daily average undrawn portion of revolving and DDTL\\ncommitments. Applicable interest and commitment fees are payable quarterly or more or less frequently in certain circumstances. The 2014 Credit Facility also\\nallows for an incremental loan facility of additional term loans or revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount up to the amount and upon the terms and\\nconditions set forth therein with one or more existing or new lenders upon mutual agreement between the Company and such lenders.\\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding debt balances and an aggregate of $950.0 million undrawn of revolving and DDTL commitments\\nunder the 2014 Credit Facility.\\nThe 2014 Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, and certain financial and nonfinancial covenants, including but not limited to\\nmaintaining minimum liquidity of $50.0 million, and certain limitations on liens and indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants\\nassociated with the 2014 Credit Facility as of March 31, 2023.\\n7. Commitments and Contingencies\\nPurchase Commitments\\nIn December 2019, the Company entered into, and subsequently amended, a minimum annual commitment to purchase cloud hosting services of at least\\n$1.49 billion over six contract years, with an optional carryover period through September 30, 2029, in exchange for various discounts on such services. If the\\nspend does not meet the minimum annual commitment each year or at the end of the term, the Company is obligated to make a return payment. If the\\ndifference is greater than $30.0 million for each of the first three contract years or $50.0 million for each of the contract years thereafter (“relief amounts”), the\\nCompany has the option to pay the respective relief amount for that year for services to be utilized in the future and the excess amount of the difference above\\nthe relief amount would be added to the minimum annual commitment of the following year through the end of the contract. As of March 31, 2023, the\\nCompany satisfied $82.3 million of its $199.0 million commitment for contract year three ending September 30, 2023.\\nLitigation and Legal Proceedings\\nFrom time to time, third parties may assert patent infringement claims against the Company. In addition, from time to time, the Company may be subject to\\nother legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual\\nproperty rights; employment claims; securities claims; investor claims; corporate claims; class action claims; and general contract, tort, or other claims. The\\nCompany may from time to time also be subject to various legal or government claims, disputes, or investigations. Such matters may include, but not be\\nlimited to, claims, disputes, allegations, or investigations related to warranty; refund; breach of contract; breach, leak, or misuse of personal data or confidential\\ninformation; employment; government procurement; intellectual property; government regulation or compliance (including but not limited to anti-corruption\\nrequirements, export or other trade controls, data privacy or data protection, cybersecurity requirements, or antitrust/competition law requirements); securities;\\ninvestor; corporate; or other matters. The Company establishes an accrual for loss contingencies when the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable.\\nOn September 15, 2022, October 25, 2022, and November 4, 2022, putative securities class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for\\nthe District of Colorado, captioned Cupat v. Palantir Technologies Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-02384, Allegheny County Employees’ Retirement System v.\\nPalantir Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-02805, and Shijun Liu, Individually and as Trustee of the Liu Family Trust 2019 v. Palantir Technologies\\nInc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-02893, respectively, naming the Company and certain current and former officers and directors as defendants. The suits allege\\nfalse and misleading statements about our business and prospects, and purport to allege claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\\n“Exchange Act”) and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),\\n13\\nTable of contents\\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\nand seek unspecified damages and remedies under Sections 10(b), 20(a), and 20(A) of the Exchange Act and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act. These\\nthree actions subsequently were consolidated as Cupat v. Palantir Technologies Inc., et al., Lead Civil Action No. 1:22-cv-02834-CNS-SKC, consolidated with\\ncivil actions 1:22-cv-02805-CNS-SKC and 1:22-cv-02893-CNS-SKC. On November 21, 2022 and January 13, 2023, stockholder derivative actions were filed\\nin the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, captioned Li v. Karp, et al., Case No. 22-cv-3028 and Parmenter v. Karp, et al., Case No. 23-cv-\\n118, and on January 27, 2023, a stockholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware captioned Miao v. Karp,\\net al., Case No. 1:23-cv-00103-MN, each against certain current and former officers and directors asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating\\nto the allegations of the securities class action complaints and seek unspecified damages and injunctive remedies under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and\\nDelaware law. Because the litigation is in early stages, the Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result\\nfrom these matters.\\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company was not aware of any currently pending legal matters or claims, individually or in the aggregate, that were expected to\\nhave a material adverse impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\\nLetters of Credit and Guarantees\\nThe Company had irrevocable standby letters of credit and guarantees, including bank guarantees, outstanding in the amounts of $24.0 million and $28.8\\nmillion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which were fully collateralized. The Company is required to maintain these letters of credit\\nand guarantees primarily in connection with operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements. As of\\nMarch 31, 2023, these letters of credit and guarantees had expiration dates through August 2031.\\nWarranties and Indemnification\\nThe Company generally provides a warranty for its software products and services and a service level agreement (“SLA”) for the Company’s performance of\\nsoftware operations. The Company’s products are generally warranted to perform substantially as described in the associated product documentation during the\\nsubscription term or for a period of up to 90 days where the software is hosted by the customer, and the Company includes operations and maintenance\\n(“O&M”) services as part of its subscription and license agreements to support this warranty and maintain the operability of the software. The Company’s\\nservices are generally warranted to be performed in a professional manner and by an adequate staff with knowledge about the products. In the event there is a\\nfailure of such warranties, the Company generally is obligated to correct the product or service to conform to the warranty provision, or, if the Company is\\nunable to do so, the customer is entitled to seek a refund of the purchase price of the product and service (generally prorated over the contract term). Due to the\\nabsence of historical warranty claims, the Company’s expectations of future claims related to products under warranty continue to be insignificant. The\\nCompany has not recorded warranty expense or related accruals as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\\nThe Company generally agrees to indemnify its customers against legal claims that the Company’s software products infringe certain third-party intellectual\\nproperty rights and accounts for its indemnification obligations. In the event of such a claim, the Company is generally obligated to defend its customer against\\nthe claim and to either settle the claim at the Company’s expense or pay damages that the customer is legally required to pay to the third-party claimant. In\\naddition, in the event of an infringement, the Company generally agrees to secure the right for the customer to continue using the infringing product; to modify\\nor replace the infringing product; or, if those options are not commercially practicable, to refund the cost of the software, as prorated over the period. To date,\\nthe Company has not been required to make any payment resulting from infringement claims asserted against its customers and does not believe that the\\nCompany will be liable for such claims in the foreseeable future. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for infringement costs as of March 31, 2023\\nand December 31, 2022.\\nThe Company has obligations under certain circumstances to indemnify each of the defendant directors and certain officers against judgments, fines,\\nsettlements, and expenses related to claims against such directors and certain officers and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under the law and the\\nCompany’s Amended and Restated Bylaws and Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\\n8. Stockholders\\' Equity\\nThe Company’s Class A, Class B, and Class F common stock (collectively, the “common stock”) all have the same rights, except with respect to voting and\\nconversion rights. Class A and Class B common stock have voting rights of 1 and 10 votes per share, respectively. The Class F common stock has the voting\\nrights generally described herein and each share of Class F common stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder thereof, into one share of Class\\nB common stock. All shares of Class F common stock are held in a voting trust established by Stephen Cohen, Alexander Karp, and Peter Thiel (the\\n14\\nTable of contents\\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\n“Founders”). The Class F common stock generally gives the Founders the ability to control up to 49.999999% of the total voting power of the Company\\'s\\ncapital stock, so long as the Founders and certain of their affiliates collectively meet a minimum ownership threshold, which was 100.0 million of the\\nCompany\\'s equity securities as of March 31, 2023.\\nHolders of the common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all\\nclasses of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. No dividends have been declared as of March 31, 2023.\\nThe following represented the total authorized, issued, and outstanding shares for each class of common stock (in thousands):\\nAs of March 31, 2023\\nAs of December 31, 2022\\nAuthorized\\nIssued and\\nOutstanding\\nAuthorized\\nIssued and\\nOutstanding\\nClass A Common Stock\\n20,000,000 \\n2,013,044 \\n20,000,000 \\n1,995,414 \\nClass B Common Stock\\n2,700,000 \\n103,681 \\n2,700,000 \\n102,656 \\nClass F Common Stock\\n1,005 \\n1,005 \\n1,005 \\n1,005 \\nTotal\\n22,701,005 \\n2,117,730 \\n22,701,005 \\n2,099,075 \\n9.

Income Taxes\\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.7 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\\nCompany is subject to income tax in the U.S. as well as other tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business. The Company’s effective tax rate as of March 31,\\n2023 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed at different rates, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and valuation\\nallowances recorded on its deferred tax assets from the U.S., United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and other jurisdictions. There was no material change in the provision\\nfor income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022.\\nThe realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in future periods. The Company\\nassesses its ability to realize the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, and it establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of\\nthe deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company weighs all available positive and negative evidence, including its earnings history and results of\\nrecent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. For example, due to the weight of\\nobjectively verifiable negative evidence, including its history of U.S. and U.K. net operating tax losses, the Company believes that it is more likely than not\\nthat its U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance on its U.S. and U.K.\\ndeferred tax assets as of March 31, 2023.\\n11.

Segment and Geographic Information\\nThe following reporting segment tables reflect the results of the Company’s reportable operating segments consistent with the manner in which the chief\\noperating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates the performance of each segment and allocates the Company’s resources. The CODM does not evaluate the\\nperformance of the Company’s assets on a segment basis for internal management reporting and, therefore, such information is not presented.\\nContribution is used, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of the segments. A segment’s contribution is calculated as segment\\nrevenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. It excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to segments because\\nthey are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development\\nexpenses, and general and administrative expenses.\\nFinancial information for each reportable segment was as follows (in thousands):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nRevenue:\\nGovernment\\n$\\n289,070 $\\n241,790 \\nCommercial\\n236,116 \\n204,567 \\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n525,186 $\\n446,357 \\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nContribution:\\nGovernment\\n$\\n166,233 $\\n139,810 \\nCommercial\\n112,927 \\n112,608 \\nTotal contribution\\n$\\n279,160 $\\n252,418 \\nThe reconciliation of contribution to income (loss) from operations is as follows (in thousands):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nIncome (loss) from operations\\n$\\n4,115 $\\n(39,439)\\nResearch and development expenses\\n70,176 \\n61,696 \\nGeneral and administrative expenses \\n90,155 \\n80,838 \\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\\n114,714 \\n149,323 \\nTotal contribution\\n$\\n279,160 $\\n252,418 \\n—————\\n Excludes stock-based compensation expense.\\n (1)\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n17\\nTable of contents\\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\nGeographic Information\\nRevenue by geography is based on the customer’s headquarters or agency location at the time of sale.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated\\nfinancial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking\\nstatements based upon current plans, expectations, and beliefs, involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those\\nanticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should review the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion\\nof forward-looking statements and the section titled “Risk Factors” for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the\\nresults described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on\\nForm 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\\nOverview\\nWe build software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations at scale.\\nWe were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and\\noperations. We later began working with commercial enterprises, who often faced fundamentally similar challenges in working with data.\\nWe have built three principal software platforms, Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo.\\nGotham and Foundry enable institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their operations. For over a\\ndecade, Gotham has surfaced insights for global defense agencies, the intelligence community, disaster relief organizations and beyond. Foundry is becoming a\\ncentral operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries.\\nApollo, which we began offering as a commercial solution in 2021, is a cloud-agnostic, single control layer that coordinates ongoing delivery of new features,\\nsecurity updates, and platform configurations, helping to ensure the continuous operation of critical systems. Apollo allows our customers to run their software\\nin virtually any environment.\\nWe are in the process of developing and releasing components of our newest offering, the Artificial Intelligence Platform (“AIP”). AIP is designed for\\ncustomers across the commercial and government sectors, enabling them to derive value from recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence via the\\ncombination of our existing software platforms with large language models (“LLMs”). We believe AIP uniquely allows users to connect LLMs with their data\\nand operations to facilitate decision-making within the legal, ethical, and security constraints that they require.\\nWhile our focus in the short term remains on making our software platforms available to increasingly broad swaths of the market, we are also working to\\nidentify additional component parts and products embedded within those platforms that have potential as commercial offerings on their own.\\nWe believe that every institution faces challenges that our platforms and products were designed to address. Our approach with all our clients is to establish a\\npartnership that transforms the way they use data in pursuit of their goals.\\nWe regularly evaluate partnerships and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, technologies, and intellectual property rights\\nin an effort to expand our product and service offerings.\\nOur Business\\nOur customers pay us to use the software platforms we have built. While we generally offer contract terms of one to five years in length, our customers\\nsometimes enter into shorter-term contracts. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Many of our customer contracts contain\\ntermination for convenience provisions.\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated $525.2 million in revenue, reflecting an 18% growth rate from the three months ended March 31,\\n2022, when we generated $446.4 million in revenue.\\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated income from operations of $4.1 million, or adjusted income from operations of $125.1 million when\\nexcluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, we incurred losses from operations of\\n$39.4 million, or generated adjusted income from operations of $117.4 million when excluding stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes.\\n21\\nTable of contents\\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2023, our gross profit was $417.5 million, reflecting a gross margin of 80%, or 81% when excluding stock-based\\ncompensation. In the three months ended March 31, 2022, our gross profit was $352.0 million, reflecting a gross margin of 79%, or 81% when excluding\\nstock-based compensation.\\nFor more information about our adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes; and gross\\nprofit and gross margin when excluding stock-based compensation; as well as reconciliations from income (loss) from operations and gross profit, see the\\nsection titled “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” below.\\nOur Customers\\nWe define a customer as an organization from which we have recognized revenue during the trailing twelve-month period. During the period ended March 31,\\n2023, we had 391 customers, including companies in various commercial sectors and government agencies around the world. During the period ended March\\n31, 2022, we had 277 customers.\\nFor large government agencies, where a single institution has multiple divisions, units, or subsidiary agencies, each such division, unit, or subsidiary agency\\nthat enters into a separate contract with us and is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. For example, while the U.S. Food and Drug\\nAdministration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health are subsidiary agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and\\nHuman Services, we treat each of those agencies as a separate customer given that the governing structures and procurement processes of each agency are\\nindependent.\\nWe have built lasting and significant customer relationships and partnerships with some of the world’s leading government institutions and companies. Our\\naverage revenue for the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was $50.9 million, which grew 14% from an average of\\n$44.6 million in revenue from the top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022, demonstrating our expanding relationships\\nwith existing customers.\\nOrganizations in the commercial and government sectors face similar challenges when it comes to managing data, and we intend to expand our reach in both\\nmarkets moving forward. Our decisions about which customer relationships require further investment may change over time, based on our assessment of the\\npotential long-term value that our software can generate for them. We enter into initial pilots with customers, generally at our own expense and without a\\nguarantee of future returns, in order to access a unique set of opportunities that others may pass over for lack of resources and shorter investment horizons. We\\nmanage customers at the account level, not by industry or sector, so that we can optimize on the specific growth opportunities for each customer. In the three\\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, 55% of our revenue came from government customers and 45% came from commercial customers.\\nOur U.S. customers have been a meaningful source of revenue growth for our business. In the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated 64% of our\\nrevenue from customers in the United States and the remaining 36% from non-U.S. customers. Revenue from our U.S. customers during the trailing twelve\\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 was $1.2 billion, which grew 28% from the prior twelve-month period. We expect that U.S. customers will continue to be a\\nsource of significant revenue growth for us.\\nWe continue to believe that our government customers remain a meaningful and resilient source of revenue for our business, particularly during periods of\\neconomic uncertainty. However, large government customers, in particular, are generally subject to a number of uncertainties regarding budgets and spending\\nlevels, changes in timing and spending priorities, and regulatory and policy changes, which can make it difficult to predict when, or if, we will make sales to\\nsuch customers or the size and scope of any contract awards. See also the discussion of “Risks Related to Relationships and Business with the Public Sector”\\nwithin “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nExpansion of Access to Platforms\\nThe speed with which our platforms can be deployed has significantly expanded the range of potential customers with which we plan on partnering over the\\nlong term. We anticipate that our reach among an increasingly broad set of customers, in both the commercial and government sectors, will accelerate moving\\nforward. We believe that, as these new partners grow, we will grow with them.\\nWe have also made a number of investments in companies whose businesses rely on the ability of their organizations to manage and analyze data effectively at\\nscale.\\nOur proximity to these businesses and the industries in which they are operating has enhanced, and is expected to continue enhancing, our own product and\\nbusiness development efforts, as we continue expanding access to our platforms to the broadest possible set of customers.\\n22\\nTable of contents\\nMacroeconomic Trends\\nAs a corporation with an international presence, we are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including,\\nbut not limited to, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising inflation and interest rates, monetary policy\\nchanges, financial services sector instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, these macroeconomic impacts have generally disrupted the\\noperations of our customers and prospective customers. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and\\nfinancial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape.\\nSee the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the impact of macroeconomic trends\\non our business.\\nCOVID-19 Impact\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial conditions or results of operations\\nin future periods remains uncertain, but to date has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We continue to prioritize the health and\\nsafety of our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. We have reopened our offices and have allowed business travel and in-\\nperson events to resume, while continuing to closely monitor developments around the evolving nature of the pandemic. As such, our travel and office-related\\nexpenditures have increased, and may continue to increase moving forward. However, we expect that some of our employees will continue to work remotely.\\nThe economic effects of the pandemic and resulting societal changes are currently not predictable.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made clear to many of our customers that accommodating the extended timelines ordinarily required to realize results from\\nimplementing new software solutions is not an option during a crisis. As a result, customers are increasingly adopting our software, which can be ready in days,\\nover internal software development efforts, which may take months or years.\\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict\\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and its global impacts on our business. While the conflict is still evolving\\nand the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not expect that the Russian invasion will have a material impact on our business and results of operations. We\\ndo not currently have office locations in Russia and none of our revenues came from sales to entities headquartered in Russia. In June 2022, our Chief\\nExecutive Officer, Alexander Karp, met with the President of Ukraine and other senior officials to discuss opening an office in Ukraine and providing ongoing\\nsupport. Our current operations related to Ukraine are not material to our financial position or results of operations. However, if the conflict continues or\\nworsens, leading to greater disruptions and uncertainty within the technology industry or global economy, our business and results of operations could be\\nnegatively impacted.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\\nExchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes and political and economic\\nuncertainty which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.\\nOur contracts with customers are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other major foreign\\ncurrencies (primarily the Euro and British pound sterling (“GBP”)) has had and could in the future have an unfavorable impact on our revenues from certain\\nnon-U.S. customers; however, that impact for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was not material to our financial position or results of operations.\\nAdditionally, certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries may hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency (primarily\\nthe Japanese Yen (“JPY”), Euro and GBP), which could subject our results of operations and cash flows to adverse fluctuations due to changes in such foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar.\\nCustomer Impacts\\nCurrent macroeconomic conditions may also adversely impact our customers’ business, particularly our early- and growth-stage customers. Relationships with\\nearly- or growth-stage customers carry inherent risks because, among other things, such customers may be unable to generate sufficient revenues or\\nprofitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely manner or on favorable terms to them in the current macroeconomic environment,\\nwhich has impacted, and may continue to impact, our expected revenue and collections. As a result, current macroeconomic conditions have impacted, and may\\ncontinue to impact, our ability to realize the full value of our commercial contracts with such early- or growth-stage customers. For additional information, see\\nNote 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\\nQ.\\n23\\nTable of contents\\nKey Business Measure\\nIn addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measure to help us\\nevaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions.\\nContribution Margin\\nWe believe that the revenue we generate relative to the costs we incur in order to generate such revenue is an important measure of the efficiency of our\\nbusiness. We define contribution margin as revenue less our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, divided\\nby revenue.\\nRevenue is allocated to each customer account directly. The cost of revenue and sales and marketing costs include both the costs associated with the\\ndeployment and operation of our software as well as expenses associated with identifying new customers and expanding partnerships with existing ones. Our\\nsoftware engineers working with existing customers often manage the deployment and operation of our platforms as well as identify new ways that those\\nplatforms can be used. To calculate the contribution by segment, we allocate cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based\\ncompensation, to an account pro rata based on headcount and time spent on the account during the period. To the extent certain costs or personnel are not\\ndirectly assigned to a specific account, they are allocated pro rata based on total headcount staffed during such period. Direct costs, such as third-party cloud\\nhosting services, are directly allocated to the account to which they relate. Allocated revenues and expenses are then aggregated into a segment based upon the\\ncustomer account to which they relate.\\nContribution margin, both across our business and segments, is intended to capture how much we have earned from customers after accounting for the costs\\nassociated with deploying and operating our software, as well as any sales and marketing expenses involved in acquiring and expanding our partnerships with\\nthose customers, including allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is a noncash expense.\\nWe believe that our contribution margin provides an important measure of the efficiency of our operations over time. We have included contribution margin\\nbecause it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our performance, and we believe that it also provides useful information to investors and\\nothers in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Our calculation of contribution margin may differ\\nfrom similarly titled measures, if any, reported by other companies. Contribution margin should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for,\\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\\nFor more information about contribution margin, including the limitations of this measure, and a reconciliation to income (loss) from operations, see the\\nsection titled “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” below.\\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\\nWe use the non-GAAP measures contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and adjusted income from\\noperations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our\\nbusiness, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a noncash expense,\\nfrom these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational\\nperformance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our\\nmanagement team. Additionally, we exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of our control.\\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not\\npublish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our\\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based\\ncompensation; and adjusted income from operations should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in\\naccordance with GAAP.\\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. We encourage\\ninvestors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to\\nview these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\\n24\\nTable of contents\\nContribution Margin\\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of contribution margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nIncome (loss) from operations\\n$\\n4,115 \\n$\\n(39,439)\\nAdd:\\nResearch and development expenses\\n70,176 \\n61,696 \\nGeneral and administrative expenses \\n90,155 \\n80,838 \\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\\n114,714 \\n149,323 \\nTotal contribution\\n$\\n279,160 \\n$\\n252,418 \\nContribution margin\\n53 %\\n57 %\\n————\\n Excludes stock-based compensation.\\nGross Profit and Gross Margin, Excluding Stock-Based Compensation\\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2023\\nand 2022 (in thousands, except percentages):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nGross profit\\n$\\n417,541 \\n$\\n351,954 \\nAdd: stock-based compensation\\n9,177 \\n11,677 \\nGross profit, excluding stock-based compensation\\n$\\n426,718 \\n$\\n363,631 \\nGross margin, excluding stock-based compensation\\n81 %\\n81 %\\nAdjusted Income from Operations\\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll\\ntaxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nIncome (loss) from operations\\n$\\n4,115 $\\n(39,439)\\nAdd: stock-based compensation\\n114,714 \\n149,323 \\nAdd: employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation\\n6,285 \\n7,506 \\nAdjusted income from operations\\n$\\n125,114 $\\n117,390 \\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nRevenue\\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access our software in our hosted environment along with ongoing operating and maintenance (“O&M”)\\nservices (“Palantir Cloud”), software subscriptions in our customers’ environments with ongoing O&M services (“On-Premises Software”), and professional\\nservices.\\nPalantir Cloud\\nOur Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir and are sold\\ntogether with stand-ready O&M services, as further described below. We agree to provide continuous access to the hosted software throughout the contract\\nterm. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the\\ntransfer of control of the Palantir services to the customer.\\n (1)\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n25\\nTable of contents\\nOn-Premises Software\\nSales of our software subscriptions grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their\\nown cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&M services. O&M services include critical updates and support\\nand maintenance services required to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term.\\nBecause of this requirement, we have concluded that the software subscriptions and O&M services, which together we refer to as our On-Premises Software,\\nare highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is generally\\nrecognized over the contract term on a ratable basis.\\nProfessional Services\\nOur professional services support the customers’ use of the software and include, as needed, on-demand user support, user-interface configuration, training, and\\nongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of on-demand professional services for the\\nduration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud or On-Premises Software subscriptions. Professional services\\nare on-demand, whereby we perform services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&M and professional\\nservices, as well as field-service representatives, third-party cloud hosting services, travel costs, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\\nWe expect that cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars as our revenue grows and will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.\\nSales and Marketing\\nOur sales and marketing efforts span all stages of our sales cycle, including personnel involved with sales functions, and executing pilots at new or existing\\ncustomers. Sales and marketing costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for our sales force and personnel involved in\\nsales functions executing on pilots and customer growth activities; as well as third-party cloud hosting services for our pilots, marketing and sales event-related\\ncosts, travel costs, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing costs are generally expensed as incurred.\\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our potential and current customers, in growing our\\nbusiness, sales force, and enhancing our brand awareness.\\nResearch and Development\\nOur research and development efforts are aimed at continuing to develop and refine our platforms, including adding new platforms, features and modules,\\nincreasing their functionality, and enhancing the usability of our platforms. Research and development costs primarily include salaries, stock-based\\ncompensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing the activities to develop and refine our platforms, internal use third-party cloud\\nhosting services and other IT-related costs, travel costs, and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nWe plan to continue to invest in personnel to support our research and development efforts. As a result, we expect that research and development expenses will\\nincrease in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to support these activities.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative costs include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in our executive, finance, legal,\\nhuman resources, and administrative functions, as well as third-party professional services and fees, travel costs, and allocated overhead.\\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we enhance our systems, processes, and controls to support the growth\\nin our business as well as our continuing compliance and reporting requirements as a public company.\\nInterest Income\\nInterest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, U.S. treasury securities, and restricted cash balances.\\n26\\nTable of contents\\nInterest Expense\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense and commitment fees incurred under our credit facility.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, realized and unrealized losses from Investments, and our share\\nof income and losses from our equity method investments.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nProvision for income taxes consists of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business and withholding taxes.\\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our joint venture partners’ proportionate share of the results of operations of the respective joint\\nventure.\\nSegments\\nWe have two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision maker, who\\nis our chief executive officer, manages our operations for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including our\\norganizational and management reporting structure and customer type, were considered in determining these operating segments.\\nOur operating segments are described below:\\n•\\nCommercial: This segment primarily serves customers working in non-government industries.\\n•\\nGovernment: This segment primarily serves customers that are U.S. government and non-U.S. government agencies.\\nSegment profitability is evaluated based on contribution and contribution margin. Contribution is segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales\\nand marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Contribution margin is contribution divided by revenue. To the extent costs of revenue\\nor sales and marketing expenses are not directly attributable to a particular segment, they are allocated based upon headcount at each operating segment during\\nthe period. We use it, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of our operating segments, which excludes certain operating\\nexpenses that are not allocated to operating segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include\\nstock-based compensation expense, research and development costs, and general and administrative costs, such as legal and accounting costs.\\n27\\nTable of contents\\nResults of Operations\\nThe following table summarizes our condensed consolidated statements of operations data (in thousands):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nRevenue\\n$\\n525,186 $\\n446,357 \\nCost of revenue\\n107,645 \\n94,403 \\nGross profit\\n417,541 \\n351,954 \\nOperating expenses:\\nSales and marketing\\n187,093 \\n160,485 \\nResearch and development\\n90,100 \\n88,601 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n136,233 \\n142,307 \\nTotal operating expenses\\n413,426 \\n391,393 \\nIncome (loss) from operations\\n4,115 \\n(39,439)\\nInterest income\\n20,853 \\n547 \\nInterest expense\\n(1,275)\\n(594)\\nOther income (expense), net\\n(2,861)\\n(59,870)\\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes\\n20,832 \\n(99,356)\\nProvision for income taxes\\n1,681 \\n2,023 \\nNet income (loss)\\n19,151 \\n(101,379)\\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n2,349 \\n— \\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n16,802 $\\n(101,379)\\nThe following table sets forth the components of our condensed consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nRevenue\\n100 %\\n100 %\\nCost of revenue\\n20 \\n21 \\nGross margin\\n80 \\n79 \\nOperating expenses:\\nSales and marketing\\n36 \\n36 \\nResearch and development\\n17 \\n20 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n26 \\n32 \\nTotal operating expenses\\n79 \\n88 \\nIncome (loss) from operations\\n1 \\n(9)\\nInterest income\\n4 \\n— \\nInterest expense\\n— \\n— \\nOther income (expense), net\\n(1)\\n(13)\\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes\\n4 \\n(22)\\nProvision for income taxes\\n— \\n1 \\nNet income (loss)\\n4 %\\n(23)%\\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n1 \\n— \\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\\n3 %\\n(23)%\\n28\\nTable of contents\\nComparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 and 2022\\nRevenue\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\nChange\\n2023\\n2022\\nAmount\\n%\\nRevenue:\\nGovernment\\n$\\n289,070 $\\n241,790 $\\n47,280 \\n20 %\\nCommercial\\n236,116 \\n204,567 \\n31,549 \\n15 %\\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n525,186 $\\n446,357 $\\n78,829 \\n18 %\\nRevenue increased by $78.8 million, or 18%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.

These increases were partially offset by\\na decrease of $2.7 million in stock-based compensation expense and related expenses. For additional information, see the section titled “Stock-Based\\nCompensation” below.\\nOur gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from 79% for the same period in 2022 to 80% as a result of revenue growth outpacing\\ncosts of revenue.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.6 million in payroll and other payroll-related costs\\ndriven by an increase in headcount attributable to our general and administrative functions.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\nChange\\n2023\\n2022\\nAmount\\n%\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n9,177 $\\n11,677 $\\n(2,500)\\n(21)%\\nSales and marketing\\n39,535 \\n49,272 \\n(9,737)\\n(20)%\\nResearch and development\\n19,924 \\n26,905 \\n(6,981)\\n(26)%\\nGeneral and administrative\\n46,078 \\n61,469 \\n(15,391)\\n(25)%\\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\\n$\\n114,714 $\\n149,323 $\\n(34,609)\\n(23)%\\nStock-based compensation expenses decreased by $34.6 million, or 23%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.\\nThe decrease was driven by lower expense under the accelerated attribution method for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted prior to September 30, 2020,\\nthe date of our direct listing, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, as well as lower expense due to options\\nbecoming fully vested and the cancellation of options and RSUs.\\nInterest Income\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\nChange\\n2023\\n2022\\nAmount\\nInterest income\\n$\\n20,853 \\n$\\n547 $\\n20,306 \\nInterest income increased by $20.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in\\nU.S. interest rates on interest earned from our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; and new investments in U.S. treasury securities.\\nInterest Expense\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\nChange\\n2023\\n2022\\nAmount\\nInterest expense\\n$\\n(1,275) $\\n(594) $\\n(681)\\nInterest expense increased by $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the amortization\\nof upfront debt issuance costs.\\n30\\nTable of contents\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\nChange\\n2023\\n2022\\nAmount\\nOther income (expense), net\\n$\\n(2,861) $\\n(59,870)\\n$\\n57,009 \\nOther income (expense), net changed by $57.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to net\\ndecrease in losses from our shares held in publicly-traded equity securities.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\nChange\\n2023\\n2022\\nAmount\\nProvision for income taxes\\n$\\n1,681 $\\n2,023 $\\n(342)\\nThere was no material change in the provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe generated positive cash flow from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We had cash and cash equivalents and short-term U.S. treasury\\nsecurities totaling $2.9 billion available as of March 31, 2023. We believe that cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents, marketable\\nsecurities, available funds and access to financing sources, including our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at\\nleast the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. We have historically\\ngenerated significant losses from our operations as reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and we expect cash flow from operations may\\nfluctuate for the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities, including proceeds from\\noption exercises, and payments received from our customers.\\nAs of March 31, 2023, our accumulated deficit balance was $5.8 billion, and our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and short-term\\nU.S. treasury securities totaling $2.9 billion.\\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had no outstanding debt balances and additional available and undrawn revolving and delayed draw term loan (“DDTL”)\\ncommitments of $950.0 million under our credit facility. For more information, see Note 6. Debt in our condensed consolidated financial statements included\\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the rate of our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers and\\ntheir willingness and ability to pay for our products and services, and the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to market and develop our\\nproducts. Further, we may enter into future arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, strategic partnerships, and technologies. As\\nsuch, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able\\nto raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If additional funds are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition, and\\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nNet cash provided by (used in):\\nOperating activities\\n$\\n187,376 $\\n35,477 \\nInvesting activities\\n(1,554,591)\\n(96,468)\\nFinancing activities\\n25,983 \\n27,241 \\nEffect of foreign exchange on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\\n2,676 \\n(727)\\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\\n$\\n(1,338,556) $\\n(34,477)\\n31\\nTable of contents\\nOperating Activities\\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $187.4 million and $35.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\\nincrease was primarily driven by timing of the receipt of payments from our customers, and timing of payments to vendors.\\nInvesting Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion and $96.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in cash\\nused by investing activities was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities, primarily comprised of U.S. treasury securities, offset by proceeds from\\nsales and redemptions of marketable securities.\\nFinancing Activities\\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $26.0 million and $27.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, each of\\nwhich primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options.\\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\\nOur contractual obligations and commitments primarily consist of operating lease commitments for our facilities, and non-cancelable purchase commitments\\nrelated to third-party cloud hosting services. For additional information, refer to Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated\\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as already disclosed in Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies in our\\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there has been no material change in our contractual\\nobligations and commitments other than in the ordinary course of business since our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. See our Annual Report on Form 10-\\nK for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 21, 2023, for additional\\ninformation regarding the Company’s contractual obligations.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared\\nin accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other\\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are\\ndifferences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will\\nbe affected.\\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in\\nthe Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023, except as described in Note 2.\\nSignificant Accounting Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, if any, refer to Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in our condensed consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in the value of our investments, interest rates,\\nforeign currency exchange, and inflation.\\nMarket Risk\\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had outstanding shares of publicly-traded equity securities valued at $16.6 million. We have sold, and may continue to sell, some or\\nall of our existing equity securities. These equity securities are often in early- or growth-stage companies that have minimal public trading history; as such the\\nfair value of these equity securities may fluctuate depending on the financial outcome and prospects of the investees, as well as global market conditions\\nincluding recent and ongoing volatility related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising interest rates,\\nand\\n32\\nTable of contents\\nfinancial services sector instability. Additionally, investing in, or holding securities of, early- or growth- stage companies carries inherent risks because, among\\nother things, the technologies or products that are being developed by these companies are typically in the early phases and may never materialize or they may\\nnot achieve their growth or other business objectives, and they have and may continue to experience a decline in financial condition or file for bankruptcy,\\nwhich could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our equity holdings in these companies. We record gains or losses as the fair value of these\\ninvestments change and as we sell them. We anticipate additional volatility to our condensed consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market\\nprices and declines in financial conditions of applicable investees, and as such gains and losses are realized. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, net\\nunrealized losses related to publicly-traded equity securities held at the end of such period of $8.2 million were recorded in other income (expense), net on our\\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. We do not currently anticipate entering into new Investment Agreements, as defined in Note 4. Investments\\nand Fair Value Measurements in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to purchase, or\\ncommit to purchase, securities of special purpose acquisition companies. However, we have and may continue to accept securities as compensation or invest in\\nsecurities, which may contribute to additional volatility to our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available-for-sale debt securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and U.S. treasury\\nsecurities. Our primary investment policy and strategies are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements; however, to a\\nlesser extent we have made and may continue to make investments in early- and growth-stage companies, as disclosed in Note 4. Investments and Fair Value\\nMeasurements in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nDue to the short-term nature of the financial instruments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in\\ninterest rates.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nOur contracts with customers are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, with the remaining denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally\\ndenominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and other\\nEuropean countries. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency\\nexchange rates, particularly changes in JPY, the Euro, and GBP. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations in net income (loss) as a\\nresult of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring certain assets and liability balances that are denominated in foreign currencies. These exposures may\\nchange over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to\\nour condensed consolidated financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.\\nInflation Risk\\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to\\nsignificant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our\\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities\\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and\\nforms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nOur management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our\\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly\\nReport on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at a reasonable assurance level.\\n33\\nTable of contents\\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of\\nthe Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\\nThe effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment\\nin designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in\\ndesigning and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including\\nours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,\\nthe design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment\\nin evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods\\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\\nmay deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that\\nsuch improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.\\n34\\nTable of contents\\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Based on our current knowledge, we believe that\\nthe amount or range of reasonably possible losses will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\\noperations, or financial condition.\\nThe results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution in any legal proceedings could materially affect our future\\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement\\ncosts, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\\nFor information on legal proceedings, refer to Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation and Legal Proceedings in our condensed consolidated\\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with\\nall of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\\nand Results of Operations” and our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A\\ncommon stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us\\nor that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could\\nbe adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\\nRisk Factor Summary\\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our Class A common stock. These risks are described\\nmore fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks relating to the following:\\n•\\nwe have a history of losses, we anticipate our operating expenses will continue to increase in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain\\nprofitability in the future;\\n•\\nwe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate;\\n•\\nour sales efforts involve considerable time and expense and our sales cycle is often long and unpredictable;\\n•\\na limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenue;\\n•\\nour results of operations and our key business measures are likely to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis;\\n•\\nseasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position;\\n•\\nour platforms are complex and may have a lengthy implementation process;\\n•\\nwe may not successfully develop and deploy new technologies to address the needs of our customers;\\n•\\nour platforms must operate with third-party products and services;\\n•\\nwe may be unable to hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management and deploy our personnel and resources to meet customer\\ndemand;\\n•\\nwe may be unable to successfully build, expand, and deploy our marketing and sales organization;\\n•\\nwe may not be able to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation;\\n•\\nunfavorable news or social media coverage may harm our reputation and business;\\n•\\nexclusive arrangements or unique terms with customers or partners may result in significant risks or liabilities to us;\\n•\\nwe face intense competition in our markets;\\n•\\nwe may be unable to maintain or properly manage our culture as we grow;\\n•\\nwe may not enter into relationships with potential customers if we consider their activities to be inconsistent with our organizational mission or values;\\n•\\njoint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances may be unsuccessful;\\n35\\nTable of contents\\n•\\nwe may not be successful in executing our strategy to increase our sales to larger customers;\\n•\\nbreach of the systems of any third parties upon which we rely, our customers’ cloud or on-premises environments, or our internal systems or unauthorized\\naccess to data;\\n•\\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business\\nand operations;\\n•\\nthe market for our platforms and services may develop more slowly than we expect;\\n•\\nwe have made and may continue to make strategic investments to support key business initiatives, including in privately-held and publicly-traded\\ncompanies, as well as alternative investments, and we may not realize a return on these investments;\\n•\\nissues raised by the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) in our platforms may result in reputational harm or liability;\\n•\\nwe depend on computing infrastructure of third parties and they may experience errors, disruption, performance problems, or failure;\\n•\\nwe may fail to adequately obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights;\\n•\\nwe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims;\\n•\\nthere may be real or perceived errors, failures, defects, or bugs in our platforms;\\n•\\nwe rely on the availability of third-party technology that may be difficult to replace or that may cause errors;\\n•\\nour business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and security, technology\\nprotection, and other matters;\\n•\\nour non-U.S. sales and operations subject us to additional risks and regulations;\\n•\\nwe may encounter unfavorable outcomes in legal, regulatory, and administrative inquiries and proceedings;\\n•\\nwe may fail to receive and maintain government contracts or there may be changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector;\\n•\\nmany of our customer contracts may be terminated by the customer at any time for convenience and may contain other provisions permitting the customer\\nto discontinue contract performance;\\n•\\nwe may not realize the full deal value of our customer contracts;\\n•\\nthere may be a decline in the U.S. and other government budgets, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, or delays in contract awards; and\\n•\\nthe multi-class structure of our common stock, the Founder Voting Trust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement concentrate voting power with\\ncertain stockholders, in particular, Stephen Cohen, Alexander Karp, and Peter Thiel (our “Founders”) and their affiliates.\\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\\nWe have a history of losses, we anticipate our operating expenses will continue to increase in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain\\nprofitability in the future.\\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2022, we had incurred net losses in each period since our inception. We may not achieve or maintain profitability in future periods\\nor, if we are profitable, we may not fully achieve our profitability targets. In addition, while we remain focused on operating efficiently, we anticipate that our\\noperating expenses will continue to increase in the future. As we continue to expand our business, industry verticals, and the breadth of our operations, upgrade\\nour infrastructure, hire additional employees, expand into new markets, invest in research and development, invest in sales and marketing, including expanding\\nour sales organization and related sales-based payments that may come with such expansion, lease more real estate to accommodate our anticipated future\\ngrowth, and incur costs associated with general administration, including expenses related to being a public company, we expect that our costs of revenue and\\noperating expenses will continue to increase. To the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we may also incur increased losses because the\\ncosts associated with acquiring and growing our customers and with research and development are generally incurred upfront, while our revenue from\\ncustomer contracts is generally recognized over the contract term. Furthermore, our sales model often requires us to spend months and invest significant\\nresources working with customers on pilot deployments at no or low cost to them, which may result in no or minimal future revenue. We may also encounter\\nunforeseen or unpredictable factors, including adverse macroeconomic conditions, unforeseen operating expenses, or other complications or delays, which may\\nresult in increased costs, or cause us to generate less revenue from our customers than we have currently estimated. We may not be able to continue to increase\\nour revenue at a rate sufficient to offset increases in our costs of revenue and operating expenses in the\\n36\\nTable of contents\\nnear term or at all, which would prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability in the future. Any failure by us to maintain or increase profitability in\\nthe future or achieve our profitability targets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nWe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.\\nAlthough our revenue has increased in recent periods, there can be no assurances that revenue will continue to grow or do so at current rates, and you should\\nnot rely on the revenue of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. Our revenue growth rate has declined in recent\\nperiods, and may continue to decline in future periods. Many factors may contribute to declines in our revenue growth rate, including macroeconomic factors,\\nincreased competition, slowing demand for our platforms from existing and new customers, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities,\\nterminations of existing contracts or failure to exercise existing options by our customers, and the maturation of our business, among others. If our revenue\\ngrowth rate declines, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur sales efforts involve considerable time and expense and our sales cycle is often long and unpredictable.\\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle. As\\npart of our sales efforts, we invest considerable time and expense evaluating the specific organizational needs of our potential customers and educating these\\npotential customers about the technical capabilities and value of our platforms and services. We often also provide our platforms to potential customers at no or\\nlow cost initially to them for evaluation purposes through short-term pilot deployments of our platforms, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to\\nconvert customers from these short-term pilot deployments to full revenue-generating contracts. In addition, we have grown and may continue to grow our\\ndirect sales force, and our sales efforts have historically depended on the significant involvement of our senior management team. The length of our sales cycle,\\nfrom initial demonstration of our platforms to sale of our platforms and services, tends to be long and varies substantially from customer to customer. Our sales\\ncycle often lasts six to nine months but can extend to a year or more for some customers. Because decisions to purchase our platforms involve significant\\nfinancial commitments, potential customers generally evaluate our platforms at multiple levels within their organization, each of which often have specific\\nrequirements, and typically involve their senior management.\\nOur results of operations depend on sales to enterprise customers, which make product purchasing decisions based in part or entirely on factors, or perceived\\nfactors, not directly related to the features of the platforms, including, among others, that customer’s projections of business growth, uncertainty about\\nmacroeconomic conditions (including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and related economic sanctions,\\nrising inflation and interest rates, monetary policy changes, financial services sector instability, or foreign currency fluctuations), capital budgets, anticipated\\ncost savings from the implementation of our platforms, potential preference for such customer’s internally-developed software solutions, perceptions about our\\nbusiness and platforms, more favorable terms offered by potential competitors, and previous technology investments. In addition, certain decision makers and\\nother stakeholders within our potential customers tend to have vested interests in the continued use of internally developed or existing software, which may\\nmake it more difficult for us to sell our platforms and services. As a result of these and other factors, our sales efforts typically require an extensive effort\\nthroughout a customer’s organization, a significant investment of human resources, expense and time, including by our senior management, and there can be no\\nassurances that we will be successful in making a sale to a potential customer. If our sales efforts to a potential customer do not result in sufficient revenue to\\njustify our investments, including in our growing direct sales force, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nHistorically, existing customers have expanded their relationships with us, which has resulted in a limited number of customers accounting for a\\nsubstantial portion of our revenue. If existing customers do not make subsequent purchases from us or renew their contracts with us, or if our\\nrelationships with our largest customers are impaired or terminated, our revenue could decline, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted.\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from existing customers that expand their relationships with us. Increasing the size and number of the\\ndeployments of our existing customers is a major part of our growth strategy. We may not be effective in executing this or any other aspect of our growth\\nstrategy.\\nOur top three customers together accounted for 17% and 18% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 20% and 17%\\nof our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our top three customers by revenue, for the three months ended March 31,\\n2023, have been with us for an average of seven years as of March 31, 2023. Certain of our customers, including customers that represent a significant portion\\nof our business, have in the past reduced their spend with us or terminated their agreements with us, which has reduced our anticipated future payments or\\nrevenue from these customers, and which has required us to refund some previously paid amounts to these customers. It is not possible for us to predict the\\nfuture level of demand from our larger customers for our platforms and applications.\\n37\\nTable of contents\\nWhile we generally offer contract terms up to five years in length, our customers sometimes enter into shorter-term contracts, such as one-year subscriptions,\\nwhich may not provide for automatic renewal and may require the customer to opt-in to extend the term. Our customers have no obligation to renew, upgrade,\\nor expand their agreements with us after the terms of their existing agreements have expired. In addition, many of our customer contracts permit the customer\\nto terminate their contracts with us with notice periods of varying lengths, generally three to six months. If one or more of our customers terminate their\\ncontracts with us, whether for convenience, for default in the event of a breach by us, or for other reasons specified in our contracts, as applicable; if our\\ncustomers elect not to renew their contracts with us; if our customers renew their contractual arrangements with us for shorter contract lengths or for a reduced\\nscope; or if our customers otherwise seek to renegotiate terms of their existing agreements on terms less favorable to us, our business and results of operations\\ncould be adversely affected. This adverse impact would be even more pronounced for customers that represent a material portion of our revenue or business\\noperations.\\nOur ability to renew or expand our customer relationships may decrease or vary as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction or\\ndissatisfaction with our platforms and services, the frequency and severity of software and implementation errors, our platforms’ reliability, our pricing, the\\neffects of general economic conditions, competitive offerings or alternatives, or reductions in our customers’ spending levels. If our customers do not renew or\\nexpand their agreements with us or if they renew their contracts for shorter lengths or on other terms less favorable to us, our revenue may grow more slowly\\nthan expected or decline, and our business could suffer. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations would also be adversely affected if we face\\ndifficulty collecting our accounts receivable from our customers or if we are required to refund customer deposits.\\nAchieving renewal or expansion of deployments may require us to increasingly engage in sophisticated and costly sales efforts that may not result in additional\\nsales. In addition, our customers’ decisions to expand the deployment of our platforms depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions,\\nthe functioning of our platforms, the ability of our forward-deployed engineers to assist our customers in identifying new use cases, modernizing their data\\narchitectures, and achieving success with data-driven initiatives, and our customers’ satisfaction with our services. If our efforts to expand within our existing\\ncustomer base are not successful, our business may suffer.\\nWe may not realize the full deal value of our customer contracts, which may result in lower than expected revenue.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total remaining deal value, as defined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations—Overview—Total Remaining Deal Value” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the\\nSEC on February 21, 2023, was $3.7 billion. Of our total remaining deal value, as of December 31, 2022, $2.0 billion was the remaining deal value of our\\ncontracts with commercial customers and $1.7 billion was the remaining deal value of our contracts with government customers.\\nMany of these contracts are subject to termination for convenience provisions. Additionally, the U.S. federal government is prohibited from exercising contract\\noptions more than one year in advance. As a result, there can be no guarantee that our customer contracts will not be terminated or that contract options will be\\nexercised.\\nWe historically have not realized all of the revenue from the full deal value of our customer contracts, and we may not do so in the future. This is because the\\nactual timing and amount of revenue under contracts included are subject to various contingencies, including exercise of contractual options, customers not\\nterminating their contracts, renegotiation of contracts, and other macroeconomic factors that may potentially inhibit a customer’s ability to pay. In addition,\\ndelays in the completion of the U.S. government’s budgeting process, the use of continuing resolutions, and a potential lapse in appropriations, or similar\\nevents in other jurisdictions, has and could in the future adversely affect our ability to timely recognize revenue under certain government contracts. If we are\\nunable to realize all of the revenue from the full deal value of our customer contracts, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nOur results of operations and our key business measures are likely to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis in future periods and may not fully reflect\\nthe underlying performance of our business, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below\\nexpectations.\\nOur quarterly results of operations, including cash flows, have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Accordingly,\\nthe results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results, financial position, and operations are\\nlikely to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance\\nof our business. Fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the value of our Class A common stock.\\nWe typically close a large portion of our sales in the last several weeks of a quarter, which impacts our ability to plan and manage margins and cash flows. Our\\nsales cycle is often long, and it is difficult to predict exactly when, or if, we will actually\\n38\\nTable of contents\\nmake a sale with a potential customer, particularly large government and commercial customers. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases,\\noccurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large sales transactions in a quarter would\\nimpact our results of operations and cash flow for that quarter and any future quarters in which revenue from that transaction is lost or delayed. In addition,\\ndownturns in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our revenue because we generally recognize revenue over the term of our contracts. The timing of\\ncustomer billing and payment varies from contract to contract. A delay in the timing of receipt of such collections, or a default on a large contract, may\\nnegatively impact our liquidity for the period and in the future. Because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and require\\ntime to adjust, our results of operations and liquidity would suffer if revenue fell below our expectations in a particular period.\\nOther factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and financial position include, without limitation, those listed below:\\n•\\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts, including the success of our pilot deployments;\\n•\\nour ability to increase our contribution margins;\\n•\\nthe timing of expenses and revenue recognition;\\n•\\nthe timing and amount of payments received from our customers;\\n•\\ntermination of one or more large contracts by customers, including for convenience;\\n•\\nthe time and cost-intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and variability of sales cycles;\\n•\\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the development, maintenance, and expansion of our business and operations;\\n•\\nthe timing and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\\n•\\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\\n•\\nthe timing and success of new platforms, products, features, and functionality introduced by us or our competitors;\\n•\\ninterruptions or delays in our O&M services;\\n•\\ncyberattacks and other actual or perceived data or security breaches or incidents;\\n•\\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular, those responsible for operations and maintenance of and the selling or marketing of our platforms,\\nand develop and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales\\nleadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and marketing efforts;\\n•\\nthe amount and timing of our stock-based compensation expenses;\\n•\\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\\n•\\nchanges in the way we operate and maintain our platforms;\\n•\\nunforeseen negative results in operations from our partnerships, including those accounted for under the equity method;\\n•\\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry;\\n•\\nthe cost of and potential outcomes of existing and future claims or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;\\n•\\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business, such as the FASA;\\n•\\nindemnification payments to our customers or other third parties;\\n•\\nability to scale our business with increasing demands;\\n•\\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\\n•\\ngeneral economic, regulatory, and market conditions, including the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and\\nrelated economic sanctions and regional instability, rising inflation and interest rates, monetary policy changes, financial services sector instability, or\\nforeign currency fluctuations.\\nIn addition, many of our contracts contain termination for convenience provisions, and we may be obligated to repay prepaid amounts or otherwise not realize\\nanticipated future revenue should we fail to provide future services as anticipated. These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict financial metrics\\nfor any particular period.\\n39\\nTable of contents\\nThe variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our\\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other key metrics for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such\\nexpectations for these or any other reasons, the trading price of our Class A common stock could fall, and we could face costly lawsuits. We and certain of our\\nofficers and directors were recently sued in purported class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of\\nour management’s attention and resources. For additional information see Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies in our condensed consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position.\\nHistorically, the first quarter of our year generally has relatively lower sales, and sales generally increase in each subsequent quarter with substantial increases\\nduring our third and fourth quarters ending September 30 and December 31, respectively. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors,\\nincluding:\\n•\\nthe fiscal year end procurement cycle of our government customers, and in particular U.S. government customers which have a fiscal year end of\\nSeptember 30;\\n•\\nthe fiscal year budgeting process for our commercial customers, many of which have a fiscal year end of December 31;\\n•\\nseasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in the United States, Europe, and certain other regions; and\\n•\\ntiming of projects and our customers’ evaluation of our work progress.\\nThis seasonality has historically impacted and may in the future continue to impact the timing of collections and recognized revenue. Because a significant\\nportion of our customer contracts are typically finalized near the end of the year, and we typically invoice customers shortly after entering into a contract, we\\nmay receive a portion of our customer payments near the end of the year and record such payment as an increase in deferred revenue or customer deposits\\n(“contract liabilities”), while the revenue from our customer contracts is generally recognized over the contract term. While we have historically billed and\\ncollected payments for multiple contract years from certain customers in advance, we have and may continue to shift to collecting payments on an annual or\\nother basis.\\nWhile this has been the historical seasonal pattern of our quarterly sales, we believe that our customers’ required timing for certain new government or\\ncommercial programs requiring new software may outweigh the nature or magnitude of seasonal factors that might have influenced our business to date. As a\\nresult, we may experience future growth from additional government or commercial mandates that do not follow the seasonal purchasing and evaluation\\ndecisions by our customers that we have historically observed.\\nFor example, increased government spending on technology aimed at national defense, financial or policy regulation, cybersecurity, or healthcare mandates\\nmay drive customer demand at different times throughout our year, the timing of which we may not be able to anticipate and may cause fluctuations in our\\nresults of operations. The timing of our fiscal quarters and the U.S. federal government’s September 30 fiscal year end also may impact sales to governmental\\nagencies in the third quarter of our year, offsetting, at least in part, the otherwise seasonal downturn we have historically observed in later summer months.\\nOur rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. We\\nexpect that seasonality will continue to materially impact our business in the future and may become more pronounced over time. The seasonality of our\\nbusiness may cause continued or increased fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows, which may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or\\nannual forecasts or meeting or exceeding the expectations of research analysts or investors, which in turn may cause a decline in the trading price of our Class\\nA common stock.\\nOur platforms are complex and may have a lengthy implementation process, and any failure of our platforms to satisfy our customers or perform as\\ndesired could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\\nOur platforms and services are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of network environments. Implementing our platforms can be a complex and\\nlengthy process since we often configure our existing platforms for a customer’s unique environment. Inability to meet the unique needs of our customers may\\nresult in customer dissatisfaction and/or damage to our reputation, which could materially harm our business. Further, the proper use of our platforms may\\nrequire training of the customer and the initial or ongoing services of our technical personnel as well as O&M services over the contract term. If training and/or\\nongoing services require more of our expenditures than we originally estimated, our margins will be lower than projected.\\n40\\nTable of contents\\nIn addition, if our customers do not use our platforms correctly or as intended, inadequate performance or outcomes may result. It is possible that our platforms\\nmay also be intentionally misused or abused by customers or their employees or third parties who obtain access and use of our platforms. Similarly, our\\nplatforms sometimes are used by customers with smaller or less sophisticated IT departments, potentially resulting in sub-optimal performance at a level lower\\nthan anticipated by the customer. Because our customers rely on our platforms and services to address important business goals and challenges, the incorrect or\\nimproper use or configuration of our platforms and O&M services, failure to properly train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our platforms,\\nor failure to properly provide implementation or analytical or maintenance services to our customers may result in contract terminations or non-renewals,\\nreduced customer payments, negative publicity, or legal claims against us. For example, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to\\nproperly provide these services may result in lost opportunities for follow-on expansion sales of our platforms and services.\\nFurthermore, if customer personnel are not well trained in the use of our platforms, customers may defer the deployment of our platforms and services, may\\ndeploy them in a more limited manner than originally anticipated, or may not deploy them at all. If there is substantial turnover of the Company or customer\\npersonnel responsible for procurement and use of our platforms, our platforms may go unused or be adopted less broadly, and our ability to make additional\\nsales may be substantially limited, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and growth prospects.\\nIf we do not successfully develop and deploy new technologies to address the needs of our customers, our business and results of operations could suffer.\\nOur success has been based on our ability to design software and products that enable the integration of data into a common operating environment to facilitate\\nadvanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration. We spend substantial amounts of time and money researching and developing new\\ntechnologies and enhanced versions of existing features to meet our customers’ and potential customers’ rapidly evolving needs. There is no assurance that our\\nenhancements to our platforms or our new product features, capabilities, or offerings, including new platforms or product modules, will be compelling to our\\ncustomers or gain market acceptance. If our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate customer demand or if we fail to develop our\\nplatforms in a manner that satisfies customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing customers or increase\\ndemand for our platforms.\\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our\\nplatforms obsolete or adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may experience difficulties with software development,\\ndesign, or marketing that delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new platforms, features, or capabilities. We have in the past\\nexperienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and capabilities, and there can be no assurance that new platforms, features, or\\ncapabilities will be released according to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by customers\\nbrought against us, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, the design and development of new platforms or new features and capabilities to our\\nexisting platforms may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful. If customers do not widely adopt our\\nnew platforms, experiences, features, and capabilities, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment and our business, financial condition, and\\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\\nOur new and existing platforms and changes to our existing platforms could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\\n•\\nour failure to predict market demand accurately in terms of product functionality and to supply offerings that meet this demand in a timely fashion;\\n•\\nproduct defects, errors, or failures or our inability to satisfy customer service level requirements;\\n•\\nnegative publicity or negative private statements about the security, performance, or effectiveness of our platforms or product enhancements;\\n•\\ndelays in releasing to the market our new offerings or enhancements to our existing offerings, including new product modules;\\n•\\nintroduction or anticipated introduction of competing platforms or functionalities by our competitors;\\n•\\ninability of our platforms or product enhancements to scale and perform to meet customer demands;\\n•\\nreceiving qualified or adverse opinions in connection with security or penetration testing, certifications or audits, such as those related to IT controls and\\nsecurity standards and frameworks or compliance;\\n•\\npoor business conditions for our customers, causing them to delay software purchases;\\n•\\nreluctance of customers to purchase proprietary software products;\\n41\\nTable of contents\\n•\\nreluctance of our customers to purchase products hosted by our vendors and/or service interruption from such providers; and\\n•\\nreluctance of customers to purchase products incorporating open source software.\\nIf we are not able to continue to identify challenges faced by our customers and develop, license, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platforms in a\\ntimely and cost-effective manner, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and\\nprospects may suffer and our anticipated revenue growth may not be achieved.\\nBecause we derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from customers purchasing our platforms and products, market acceptance\\nof these platforms and products, and any enhancements or changes thereto, is critical to our success.\\nThe competitive position of our platforms depends in part on their ability to operate with third-party products and services, and if we are not successful in\\nmaintaining and expanding the compatibility of our platforms with such third-party products and services, our business, financial condition, and results of\\noperations could be adversely impacted.\\nThe competitive position of our platforms depends in part on their ability to operate with products and services of third parties, software services, and\\ninfrastructure, including but not limited to, in connection with our joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, strategic alliances, and\\nother similar arrangements where applicable. As such, we must continuously modify and enhance our platforms to adapt to changes in, or to be integrated or\\notherwise compatible with, hardware, software, networking, browser, and database technologies. In the future, one or more technology companies may choose\\nnot to support the operation of their hardware, software, or infrastructure, or our platforms may not support the capabilities needed to operate with such\\nhardware, software, or infrastructure. In addition, to the extent that a third party were to develop software or services that compete with ours, that provider may\\nchoose not to support one or more of our platforms. We intend to facilitate the compatibility of our platforms with various third-party hardware, software, and\\ninfrastructure by maintaining and expanding our business and technical relationships. If we are not successful in achieving this goal, our business, financial\\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\\nSince our founding in 2003, we have experienced rapid growth. We operate in a growing market and have experienced, and may continue to experience,\\nsignificant expansion of our operations. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, a strain on our employees, management systems, operational,\\nfinancial, and other resources. As we have grown, we have increasingly managed larger and more complex deployments of our platforms and services with a\\nbroader base of government and commercial customers. As we continue to grow, we face challenges of integrating, developing, retaining, and motivating a\\nrapidly growing employee base in various countries around the world. For example, our headcount has grown from 313 full-time employees as of December\\n31, 2010 to 3,850 full-time employees as of March 31, 2023, with employees located both in the United States and outside the United States. In the event of\\ncontinued growth of our operations, our operational resources, including our information technology systems, our employee base, or our internal controls and\\nprocedures may not be adequate to support our operations and deployments. Managing our growth may require significant expenditures and allocation of\\nvaluable management resources, improving our operational, financial, and management processes and systems, and effectively expanding, training, and\\nmanaging our employee base. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, our business, financial condition, and\\nresults of operations would be harmed. As our organization continues to grow, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our traditional\\ncompany culture, including our ability to quickly respond to customers, and avoid unnecessary delays that may be associated with a formal corporate structure.\\nThis could negatively affect our business performance or ability to hire or retain personnel in the near- or long-term.\\nIn addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our future results of operations is subject to a number\\nof uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks\\nand uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with global operations in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary level\\nof efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth, our business, financial condition, and results of\\noperations would be harmed.\\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, including Alexander Karp, one of our founders and our\\nChief Executive Officer, and deploy our personnel and resources to meet customer demand around the world, our business could suffer.\\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive technology industry depends upon our ability to attract, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. We are highly\\ndependent on the continued contributions and customer relationships of our management,\\n42\\nTable of contents\\nand particularly on the services of Alexander Karp, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Karp was part of our founding team and has been integral to our growth\\nsince our founding. We believe that Mr. Karp’s management experience would be difficult to replace. All of our executive officers and many key personnel are\\nat-will employees and may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time. The loss of the services of our key personnel and any of our other\\nexecutive officers, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in a decline in sales, delays in product development, and harm to our business\\nand operations.\\nAt times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining personnel with appropriate qualifications, and we may not\\nbe able to fill positions in a timely manner or at all. Our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be altered to address a changing\\ncandidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in a timely manner. In addition, we may incur significant costs to attract\\nand recruit skilled personnel, and we may lose new personnel to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment\\nin recruiting and training them. As we move into new geographies, we will need to attract and recruit skilled personnel in those geographic areas, but it may be\\nchallenging for us to compete with traditional local employers in these regions for talent. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our\\ncurrent personnel who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational, and managerial requirements on a timely basis or at all, our business may be\\nharmed.\\nIn addition, certain personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain customer engagements\\nor to perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed or unsuccessful, which may negatively impact our ability to perform on our U.S. and\\nnon-U.S. government contracts in a timely manner or at all.\\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our customers,\\nincluding our ability to transition personnel to new assignments on a timely basis. If we are unable to effectively utilize our personnel on a timely basis to fulfill\\nthe needs of our customers, our business could suffer. Further, if we are not able to utilize the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or\\nwork visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be\\nperformed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our personnel on customer engagements and could increase our\\ncosts.\\nWe face intense competition for qualified personnel, especially engineering personnel, in major U.S. markets, where a large portion of our personnel are based,\\nas well as in other non-U.S. markets where we have expanded or expect to expand our non-U.S. operations. We incur costs related to attracting, relocating, and\\nretaining qualified personnel in these highly competitive markets, including leasing real estate in prime areas in these locations. Further, many of the companies\\nwith which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of\\nequity and cash compensation that we offer is less attractive than that of our competitors, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled\\npersonnel. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to recruit outside of the United States. We seek to\\nretain and motivate existing personnel through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development opportunities. If we fail to attract new\\npersonnel or to retain our current personnel, our business and operations could be harmed.\\nVolatility or lack of appreciation in the trading price of our Class A common stock may also affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Many of\\nour senior personnel and other key personnel hold equity awards that have vested in part or are exercisable, which could adversely affect our ability to retain\\nthese personnel. Personnel may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options or RSUs have significantly\\nappreciated in value. In addition, many of our personnel may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may\\nreduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to successfully build, expand, and deploy our marketing and sales organization in a timely manner, or at all, or to successfully hire, retain,\\ntrain, and motivate our sales personnel, our growth and long-term success could be adversely impacted.\\nWe have grown, and may continue to grow, our direct sales force and our sales efforts have historically depended on the significant direct involvement of our\\nsenior management team, including Mr. Karp. The successful execution of our strategy to increase our sales to existing customers, identify and engage new\\ncustomers, and enter new U.S. and non-U.S. markets will depend, among other things, on our ability to successfully build and expand our sales organization\\nand operations. Identifying, recruiting, training, and managing sales personnel requires significant time, expense, and attention, including from our senior\\nmanagement and other key personnel, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the short and long term.\\n43\\nTable of contents\\nIn order to successfully scale our unique sales model, we must, and we intend to continue to, increase the size of our direct sales force, both in the United States\\nand outside of the United States, to generate additional revenue from new and existing customers while preserving the cultural and mission-oriented elements\\nof our company. If we do not hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel, our future revenue growth and business could be adversely impacted. It may\\ntake a significant period of time before our sales personnel are fully trained and productive, particularly in light of our unique sales model, and there is no\\nguarantee we will be successful in adequately training and effectively deploying our sales personnel. In addition, we have invested, and may need to continue\\ninvesting, significant resources in our sales operations to enable our sales organization to run effectively and efficiently, including supporting sales strategy\\nplanning, sales process optimization, data analytics and reporting, and administering incentive compensation arrangements. Furthermore, hiring personnel in\\nnew countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if those personnel fail to achieve full productivity in a timely manner. Our\\nbusiness would be adversely affected if our efforts to build, expand, train, and manage our sales organization are not successful. We periodically change and\\nmake adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or\\nenhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels, and other internal and external considerations. Any future sales\\norganization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. In addition, any significant change\\nto the way we structure and implement the compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive or may not be effective and may affect our revenue\\ngrowth. If we are unable to attract, hire, develop, retain, and motivate qualified sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve sufficient sales\\nproductivity levels in a reasonable period of time or at all, if our marketing programs are not effective or if we are unable to effectively build, expand, and\\nmanage our sales organization and operations, our sales and revenue may grow more slowly than expected or materially decline, and our business may be\\nsignificantly harmed.\\nOur ability to sell our platforms and satisfy our customers is dependent on the quality of our services, and our failure to offer high quality services could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\\nOnce our platforms are deployed and integrated with our customers’ existing information technology investments and data, our customers depend on our O&M\\nservices to resolve any issues relating to our platforms. Increasingly, our platforms have been deployed in large-scale, complex technology environments, and\\nwe believe our future success will depend on our ability to increase sales of our platforms for use in such deployments. Further, our ability to provide effective\\nongoing services, or to provide such services in a timely, efficient, or scalable manner, may depend in part on our customers’ environments and their upgrading\\nto the latest versions of our platforms and participating in our centralized platform management and services.\\nIn addition, our ability to provide effective services is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel with experience in\\nsupporting customers on platforms such as ours. The number of our customers has grown significantly, and that growth has and may continue to put additional\\npressure on our services teams. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for our O&M services.\\nWe also may be unable to modify the future scope and delivery of our O&M services to compete with changes in the services provided by our competitors.\\nIncreased customer demand for support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and negatively affect our business and results of operations. In\\naddition, as we continue to grow our operations and expand outside of the United States, we need to be able to provide efficient services that meet our\\ncustomers’ needs globally at scale, and our services teams may face additional challenges, including those associated with operating the platforms and\\ndelivering support, training, and documentation in languages other than English and providing services across expanded time-zones. If we are unable to provide\\nefficient O&M services globally at scale, our ability to grow our operations may be harmed, and we may need to hire additional services personnel, which\\ncould negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nOur customers typically need training in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our platforms to maximize the potential of our\\nplatforms. If we do not effectively deploy, update, or upgrade our platforms, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and\\nprovide effective ongoing services, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers could be adversely affected, we may face negative\\npublicity, and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many enterprise and government customers require higher levels of service than\\nsmaller customers. If we fail to meet the requirements of the larger customers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration\\nwith larger customers. As a result, our failure to maintain high quality services may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\\nof operations, and growth prospects.\\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our relationships with our customers, partners, and employees may be harmed, and\\nour business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity and reputation is important to our relationships with, and to our ability to attract and retain\\ncustomers, partners, investors, and employees. The successful promotion of our brand depends upon our ability to continue to offer high-quality software,\\nmaintain strong relationships with our customers, the community, and others, while successfully differentiating our platforms from those of our competitors.\\nUnfavorable media coverage may adversely affect our brand and reputation. We anticipate that as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining\\nand\\n44\\nTable of contents\\nenhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand identity and reputation, we\\nmay fail to attract and retain employees, customers, investors, or partners, grow our business, or sustain pricing power, all of which could adversely impact our\\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. Additionally, despite our internal safeguards and efforts to the contrary, we cannot\\nguarantee that our customers will not ultimately use our platforms for purposes inconsistent with our company values, and such uses may harm our brand and\\nreputation.\\nOur reputation and business may be harmed by news or social media coverage of Palantir, including but not limited to coverage that presents, or relies on,\\ninaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or otherwise damaging information.\\nPublicly available information regarding Palantir has historically been limited, in part due to the sensitivity of our work with customers or contractual\\nrequirements limiting or preventing public disclosure of certain aspects of our work or relationships with certain customers. As our business has grown and as\\ninterest in Palantir and the technology industry overall has increased and we have engaged more actively with media and marketing efforts, we have attracted,\\nand may continue to attract, significant attention from news and social media outlets, including unfavorable coverage and coverage that is not directly\\nattributable to statements authorized by our leadership, that incorrectly reports on statements made by our leadership or employees and the nature of our work,\\nperpetuates unfounded speculation about company involvements, or that is otherwise misleading. If such news or social media coverage presents, or relies on,\\ninaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or otherwise damaging information regarding Palantir, such coverage could damage our reputation in the industry and with\\ncurrent and potential customers, employees, and investors, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be adversely\\naffected. Due to the sensitive nature of our work and our confidentiality obligations and despite our ongoing efforts to provide increased transparency into our\\nbusiness, operations, and product capabilities, we may be unable to or limited in our ability to respond to such harmful coverage, which could have a negative\\nimpact on our business.\\nOur relationships with government customers and customers that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including organizations whose products or\\nactivities are or are perceived to be harmful, has resulted in public criticism, including from political and social activists, and unfavorable coverage in the\\nmedia. Activists have also engaged in public protests at our properties. Activist criticism of our relationships with customers could potentially engender\\ndissatisfaction among potential and existing customers, investors, and employees with how we address political and social concerns in our business activities.\\nConversely, being perceived as yielding to activism targeted at certain customers could damage our relationships with certain customers, including\\ngovernments and government agencies with which we do business, whose views may or may not be aligned with those of political and social activists. Actions\\nwe take in response to the activities of our customers, up to and including terminating our contracts or refusing a particular product use case could harm our\\nbrand and reputation. In either case, the resulting harm to our reputation could:\\n•\\ncause certain customers to cease doing business with us;\\n•\\nimpair our ability to attract new customers, or to expand our relationships with existing customers;\\n•\\ndiminish our ability to recruit, hire, or retain employees;\\n•\\nundermine our standing in professional communities to which we contribute and from which we receive expert knowledge; or\\n•\\nprompt us to cease doing business with certain customers.\\nAny of these factors could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nBecause we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue from our platforms and O&M services over the contractual term, downturns or upturns in new\\nsales and renewals may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations.\\nWe generally recognize revenue from our platforms and O&M services over the contractual term. As a result, a portion of the revenue we recognize in each\\nquarter is derived from customer contracts generally entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed contracts in any single\\nquarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a decline would negatively affect our revenue in future\\nquarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales or renewals, significant customer terminations, and potential changes in our contracting terms\\nand pricing policies would not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. The timing of our revenue recognition model also makes it\\ndifficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any given period, as revenue is generally recognized over the applicable contractual\\nterm.\\n45\\nTable of contents\\nOur pricing structures for our platforms and services change from time to time, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results\\nof operations.\\nWe have in the past changed, and we expect that in the future we may change, our pricing models, including as a result of competition, global economic\\nconditions, general reductions in our customers’ spending levels, pricing studies, or changes in how our platforms are broadly consumed. Similarly, as we\\nintroduce new platforms, products, and services, or as a result of the evolution of our existing platforms, products, and services, we may have difficulty\\ndetermining the appropriate price structure for our products and services, or customers may request or demand different pricing structures. In addition, as new\\nand existing competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, or revise their pricing structures, we may be unable to attract new\\ncustomers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. Moreover, as we continue to target selling our platforms and\\nservices to larger organizations, these larger organizations may demand different pricing structures or substantial price concessions. As we expand access to our\\nproducts to increasingly broad swaths of the market, our pricing model and product and service offerings for such customers have been, and will continue to be,\\ntailored to be attractive for such customers. In addition, we may need to change pricing policies to accommodate government pricing guidelines for our\\ncontracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and government agencies. If we are unable to modify or develop pricing models and strategies that\\nare attractive to existing and prospective customers, while enabling us to significantly grow our sales and revenue relative to our associated costs and expenses\\nin a reasonable period of time, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\\nIf our customers are not able or willing to accept our product-based business model, instead of a labor-based business model, our business and results of\\noperations could be negatively impacted.\\nOur platforms are generally offered on a productized basis to minimize our customers’ overall cost of acquisition, maintenance, and deployment time of our\\nplatforms. Many of our customers and potential customers are instead generally familiar with the practice of purchasing or licensing software through labor\\ncontracts, where custom software is written for specific applications, the intellectual property in such software is often owned by the customer, and the software\\ntypically requires additional labor contracts for modifications, updates, and services during the life of that specific software. Customers may be unable or\\nunwilling to accept our model of commercial software procurement. Should our customers be unable or unwilling to accept this model of commercial software\\nprocurement, our growth could be materially diminished, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth\\nprospects.\\nWe have entered into, and expect in the future to enter into, agreements with our customers that include exclusivity arrangements or unique contractual,\\npricing, or payment terms, which may result in significant risks or liabilities to us.\\nOur contracts with our customers are typically non-exclusive, but we have historically entered into arrangements with our customers and our partners that\\ninclude exclusivity provisions, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. These exclusivity provisions limit our ability to license our platforms and\\nprovide services to specific customers, or to compete in certain geographic markets and industries, which may limit our growth and negatively impact our\\nresults. In addition, we have entered into joint ventures and strategic alliances with our customers, as described below, which also limit our ability to compete\\nin certain geographic markets or industry verticals.\\nWe have entered into and may continue to enter into, in limited circumstances, unique contractual, pricing, and payment arrangements with our customers,\\nincluding some that may be outside of our typical scope of business, including arrangements relating to the receipt of noncash compensation. Our ability to sell\\nor transfer, convert to cash, or realize value from, any noncash compensation we have received, or may receive in the future, in a timely manner or at all, may\\nbe limited by, among other things, applicable securities law and regulations, and global market and macroeconomic conditions, which could adversely impact\\nour business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\\nWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\\nThe markets for our platforms are very competitive, and we expect such competition to continue or increase in the future. A significant number of companies\\nare developing products that currently, or in the future may, compete with some or all aspects of our proprietary platforms. We may not be successful in\\nconvincing the management teams of our potential customers to deploy our platforms in lieu of existing software solutions or in-house software development\\nprojects often favored by internal IT departments or other competitive products and services. In addition, our competitors include large enterprise software\\ncompanies, government contractors, and system integrators, and we may face competition from emerging companies as well as established companies who\\nhave not previously entered this market. Additionally, we may be required to make substantial additional investments in our research, development, services,\\nmarketing, and sales functions in order to respond to competition, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.\\n46\\nTable of contents\\nMany of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:\\n•\\ngreater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases;\\n•\\nlarger sales and marketing budgets and resources and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of\\nproducts;\\n•\\nbroader, deeper, or otherwise more established relationships with technology, channel and distribution partners, and customers;\\n•\\nwider geographic presence or greater access to larger potential customer bases;\\n•\\ngreater focus in specific geographies;\\n•\\nlower labor and research and development costs;\\n•\\nlarger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and\\n•\\nsubstantially greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide services, to make acquisitions, and to develop and introduce new products and\\ncapabilities.\\nIn addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and service offerings and may be able to leverage their\\nrelationships with distribution partners and customers based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner\\nthat discourages customers from purchasing our platforms, including by selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling, or offering closed technology\\nplatforms. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing provider rather than a new provider regardless of platform performance or\\nfeatures. As a result, even if the features of our platforms offer advantages that others do not, customers may not purchase our platforms. These larger\\ncompetitors often have broader product lines and market focus or greater resources and may therefore not be as susceptible to economic downturns or other\\nsignificant reductions in capital spending by customers. If we are unable to sufficiently differentiate our platforms from the integrated or bundled products of\\nour competitors, such as by offering enhanced functionality, performance, or value, we may see a decrease in demand for those platforms, which could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nIn addition, new, innovative start-up companies and larger companies that are making significant investments in research and development may introduce\\nproducts that have greater performance or functionality, are easier to implement or use, incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed, or\\nimplemented or may invent similar or superior platforms and technologies that compete with our platforms, such as platforms, products or services that\\nincorporate AI. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further\\nenhance their resources.\\nSome of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses that allow them to offer more competitive and comprehensive solutions. As a\\nresult of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors may be able to accelerate the adoption of new technologies that better address customer needs,\\ndevote greater resources to bring these products and services to market, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, or develop and expand their product\\nand service offerings more quickly than we do. These competitive pressures in our market, or our failure to compete effectively, may result in fewer orders,\\nreduced revenue and margins, and loss of market share. In addition, it is possible that industry consolidation may impact customers’ perceptions of the viability\\nof smaller or even mid-size software firms and consequently customers’ willingness to purchase from such firms.\\nWe may not compete successfully against our current or potential competitors. If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires\\nus to take costly actions in response to the actions of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In\\naddition, companies competing with us may have an entirely different pricing or distribution model. Increased competition could result in fewer customer\\norders, price reductions, reduced margins, and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\\nOur culture emphasizes rapid innovation and advancement of successful hires who may in some cases have limited prior industry expertise and prioritizes\\ncustomer outcomes over short-term financial results, and if we cannot maintain or properly manage our culture as we grow, our business may be harmed.\\nWe have a culture that encourages employees to quickly develop and launch key technologies and platforms intended to solve our customers’ most important\\nproblems and prioritizes the advancement of employees to positions of significant responsibility based on merit despite, in some cases, limited prior work or\\nindustry experience. Much of our hiring into technical roles comes through our internship program or from candidates joining us directly from undergraduate or\\ngraduate engineering programs rather than industry hires. Successful entry-level hires are often quickly advanced and rewarded with significant\\nresponsibilities,\\n47\\nTable of contents\\nincluding in important customer-facing roles as project managers, development leads, and product managers. Larger competitors, such as defense contractors,\\nsystem integrators, and large software and service companies that traditionally target large enterprises typically have more sizeable direct sales forces staffed by\\nindividuals with significantly more industry experience than our customer-facing personnel, which may negatively impact our ability to compete with these\\nlarger competitors. We have historically operated with a relatively flat reporting and organization structure and have few formal promotions. As our business\\ngrows and becomes more complex, the staffing of customer-facing personnel, some of whom may have limited industry experience, may result in unintended\\noutcomes or in decisions that are poorly received by customers or other stakeholders. For example, in many cases we launch, at our expense, pilot deployments\\nwith customers without a long-term contract in place, and some of those deployments have not resulted in the customer’s adoption or expansion of its use of\\nour platforms and services, or the generation of significant, or any, revenue or payments. In addition, as we continue to grow, including geographically, we may\\nfind it difficult to maintain our culture.\\nOur culture also prioritizes customer outcomes over short-term financial results, and we frequently make service and product decisions that may reduce our\\nshort-term revenue or cash flow if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and responsive to our customers’ goals and thereby have the\\npotential to improve our financial performance over the long term. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits and results that we expect or may\\nbe poorly received in the short term by the public markets, in which case our customer growth and our business, financial condition, and results of operations\\nmay be harmed.\\nWe may not enter into relationships with potential customers if we consider their activities to be inconsistent with our organizational mission or values.\\nWe generally do not enter into business with customers or governments whose positions or actions we consider inconsistent with our mission to support\\nWestern liberal democracy and its strategic allies. Our decisions to not enter into these relationships may not produce the long-term financial benefits and\\nresults that we expect, in which case our growth prospects, business, and results of operations could be harmed. Although we endeavor to do business with\\ncustomers and governments that are aligned with our mission and values, we cannot predict how the activities and values of our government and private sector\\ncustomers will evolve over time, and they may evolve in a manner inconsistent with our mission.\\nWe do not work with the Chinese communist party and have chosen not to host our platforms in China, which may limit our growth prospects.\\nOur leadership believes that working with the Chinese communist party is inconsistent with our culture and mission. We do not consider any sales\\nopportunities with the Chinese communist party, do not host our platforms in China, and impose limitations on access to our platforms in China in order to\\nprotect our intellectual property, to promote respect for and defend privacy and civil liberties protections, and to promote data security. Our decision to avoid\\nthis large potential market may limit our growth prospects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and we may\\nnot compete successfully against our current or potential competitors who choose to work in China.\\nJoint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\\noperations and prospects.\\nWe expect to continue to enter into joint ventures, channel sales relationships (including original equipment manufacturer and reseller relationships), platform\\npartnerships, and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. Joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, strategic\\nalliances, and other similar arrangements involve significant investments of both time and resources, and there can be no assurances that they will be\\nsuccessful. They may present significant challenges and risks, including that they may not advance our business strategy, we may get an unsatisfactory return\\non our investment or lose some or all of our investment, they may distract management and divert resources from our core business, including our business\\ndevelopment and product development efforts, they may expose us to unexpected liabilities, they may conflict with our increased sales hiring and direct sales\\nstrategy, or we may choose a partner that does not cooperate as we expect them to and that fails to meet its obligations or that has economic, business, or legal\\ninterests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. For example, in January 2021, we entered into a channel sales relationship with International Business\\nMachines Corporation (“IBM”), pursuant to which IBM is supplying a new product leveraging certain components of Foundry integrated with IBM’s Cloud\\nPak for Data. In addition, in November 2019, we created a jointly controlled entity in Japan with SOMPO Holdings, Inc., in which we subsequently obtained a\\ncontrolling interest in November 2022. For more information see Note 14. Business Combinations in the consolidated financial statements in our Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2023. We also created a jointly-owned entity in\\nSouth Korea with HD Hyundai Co. Ltd. in December 2022 in which we have a controlling interest. We believe these arrangements offer our business strategic\\noperational advantages within the Japanese and Korean markets, but they also limit our ability to independently sell our platforms, provide certain services,\\nengage certain customers, or compete in the Japanese and Korean markets or related industry verticals, which in turn limits our opportunities for growth in\\nJapan and Korea and, depending on the success of each respective entity, may negatively impact our results. Additionally, in 2016, we entered into a\\npartnership\\n48\\nTable of contents\\nwith Airbus S.A.S. (“Airbus”) that, over time, developed into the Skywise platform partnership, which provides our business strategic advantages but also\\nlimits our ability to independently provide our platforms to certain airlines and companies that compete with Airbus.\\nEntry into certain joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, or strategic alliances now or in the future may be subject to government\\nregulation, including review by U.S. or foreign government entities related to foreign direct investment. If a joint venture or similar arrangement were subject\\nto regulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term\\nbusiness strategy.\\nAs our joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances come to an end or terminate, we may be unable to renew or\\nreplace them on comparable terms, or at all. When we enter into joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances, our\\npartners may be required to undertake some portion of sales, marketing, implementation services, engineering services, or software configuration that we\\nwould otherwise provide. In such cases, our partner may be less successful than we would have otherwise been absent the arrangement and our ability to\\ninfluence, or have visibility into, the sales, marketing, and related efforts of our partners may be limited. In the event we enter into an arrangement with a\\nparticular partner, we may be less likely (or unable) to work with one or more direct competitors of our partner with which we would have worked absent the\\narrangement. We may have interests that are different from our joint venture partners and/or which may affect our ability to successfully collaborate with a\\ngiven partner. Similarly, one or more of our partners in a joint venture, channel sales relationship, platform partnership, or strategic alliance may independently\\nsuffer a bankruptcy or other economic hardship that negatively affects its ability to continue as a going concern or successfully perform on its obligation under\\nthe arrangement. In addition, customer satisfaction with our products provided in connection with these arrangements may be less favorable than anticipated,\\nnegatively impacting anticipated revenue growth and results of operations of arrangements in question. Further, some of our strategic partners offer competing\\nproducts and services or work with our competitors. As a result of these and other factors, many of the companies with which we have or are seeking joint\\nventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, or strategic alliances may choose to pursue alternative technologies and develop alternative\\nproducts and services in addition to or in lieu of our platforms, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors. If we are\\nunsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these partners, our ability to compete in a given marketplace or to grow our revenue would\\nbe impaired, and our results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful in establishing and maintaining these relationships with our partners, we cannot\\nassure you that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our platforms or increased revenue. Additionally, if our partners’ brand, reputation,\\nor products are negatively impacted in any way, that could impact our expected outcomes in those markets.\\nFurther, winding down joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, or other strategic alliances can result in additional costs, litigation, and\\nnegative publicity. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\\nIf we are not successful in executing our sales strategy, our results of operations may suffer.\\nAn important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our platforms to large enterprises and government entities. Sales to large enterprises and\\ngovernment entities involve risks that may not be present (or that are present to a lesser extent) with sales to small-to-mid-sized entities. These risks include:\\n•\\nincreased leverage held by large customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;\\n•\\nchanges in key decision makers within these organizations that may negatively impact our ability to negotiate in the future;\\n•\\ncustomer IT departments may perceive that our platforms and services pose a threat to their internal control and advocate for legacy or internally\\ndeveloped solutions over our platforms;\\n•\\nresources may be spent on a potential customer that ultimately elects not to purchase our platforms and services;\\n•\\nmore stringent requirements in our service contracts, including stricter service response times, and increased penalties for any failure to meet service\\nrequirements;\\n•\\nincreased competition from larger competitors, such as defense contractors, system integrators, or large software and service companies that traditionally\\ntarget large enterprises and government entities and that may already have purchase commitments from those customers; and\\n•\\nless predictability in completing some of our sales than we do with smaller customers.\\nLarge enterprises and government entities often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle, in some cases over twelve\\nmonths, requiring approvals of multiple management personnel and more technical personnel than would be typical of a smaller organization. Due to the\\nlength, size, scope, and stringent requirements of these evaluations, we\\n49\\nTable of contents\\ntypically provide short-term pilot deployments of our platforms at no or low cost initially. We sometimes spend substantial time, effort, and money in our sales\\nefforts without producing any sales. The success of the investments that we make in the earlier stages of our sales cycle depends on factors such as our ability\\nto identify potential customers for which our platforms have an opportunity to add significant value to the customer’s organization, our ability to identify and\\nagree with the potential customer on an appropriate pilot deployment to demonstrate the value of our platforms, and whether we successfully execute on such\\npilot deployment. Even if the pilot deployment is successful, we or the customer could choose not to enter into a larger contract for a variety of reasons. For\\nexample, product purchases by large enterprises and government entities are frequently subject to budget constraints, leadership changes, multiple approvals,\\nand unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays, any of which could significantly delay or entirely prevent our realization of sales. Finally, large\\nenterprises and government entities typically (i) have longer implementation cycles, (ii) require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader\\nrange of services, including design services, (iii) demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, (iv) sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead\\nto a delay in revenue recognition, (v) typically have more complex IT and data environments, and (vi) expect greater payment flexibility from vendors.\\nCustomers, and sometimes we, may also engage third parties to be the users of our platforms, which may result in contractual complexities and risks, require\\nadditional investment of time and human resources to train the third parties and allow third parties (who may be building competitive projects or engaging in\\nother competitive activities) to influence our customers’ perception of our platforms. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these\\ncustomers. If sales expected from a large customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our business, financial condition, results of\\noperations, and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\\nIn addition, part of our growth strategy involves supporting a broader set of potential customers. Sales to such customers involve risks that vary from those\\npresent with sales to large or otherwise established organizations, due to their limited operating history, limited resources for adopting new technologies, and\\nuncertain resources for future operations, among other things. Accordingly, we will continue to refine our business strategy and pricing structures to attract and\\nretain such customers, as well as existing and larger customers across the potential customer base. There is no guarantee that our existing or proposed business\\nstrategies, including subscription-based or usage-based pricing structures, will achieve broad adoption by current or prospective customers or be appropriately\\nstructured to attract and retain other potential customers across the customer base.\\nIf we are not successful in executing our sales strategy, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be adversely\\naffected.\\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our\\nbusiness and operations, and the duration and extent to which these factors may impact our future business, financial condition, and results of operations\\nremain uncertain.\\nWhile the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict have provided certain new opportunities for our business to expand, they\\nhave also created many negative headwinds that present risks to our business and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-\\nUkraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions have generally disrupted the operations of our customers and prospective customers, and\\nmay continue to disrupt their operations, including as a result of widespread supply chain disruptions, increases in the prices of many goods and services,\\nuncertainty in the financial markets or financial services sector, or other harm to their business and financial results. Challenging macroeconomic conditions\\ncould decrease information technology budgets for our customers and prospective customers; adversely affect demand for our platform and services; cause one\\nor more of our customers or partners to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business; cause one or more of our customers to fail to renew, terminate, or\\nseek to renegotiate their contracts with us; cause delayed purchasing decisions, longer sales cycles, extended or alternative payment terms or delayed payments;\\nimpact our ability to attract new customers on similar contractual terms or at all, or retain and expand our relationships with existing customers; and result in\\npostponed or canceled projects, all of which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including sales and cash\\nflows. For example, some of our early-stage Investee (as defined below) customers recently filed for bankruptcy and we may not realize the full value of our\\ncommercial contracts with such customers as a result. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine\\nconflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions will have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly\\nuncertain and cannot be predicted. We cannot guarantee that it will not be materially negative.\\nIn addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related work and travel restrictions, many of our field sales, operations and maintenance, and\\nprofessional services activities were conducted remotely, and a majority of our workforce worked remotely. We have reopened our offices and have allowed\\nbusiness travel to resume, but some of our employees will continue to work remotely. We have a limited history of operating with a hybrid workforce. There is\\nno guarantee that we will realize any anticipated benefits to our business from this model, including cost savings, operational efficiencies, or productivity. It is\\nalso possible that remote work arrangements may have a negative impact on our operations; the execution of our business plans; our ability to recruit, train,\\nmanage, and retain employees; our ability to maintain and strengthen our company culture; the productivity and availability of key personnel and other\\nemployees necessary to conduct our business; and on third-party\\n50\\nTable of contents\\nservice providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices. If a natural\\ndisaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees’ ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases,\\nimpossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in increased consumer privacy, data\\nsecurity, and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities may\\nbe subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments. If we are unable to successfully\\naddress the foregoing risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business and operations could be adversely affected.\\nMoreover, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and related challenging macroeconomic conditions adversely\\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, these events, alone or in combination, may also have the effect of heightening many of the\\nother risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including but not limited to, those related to maintaining company culture, our ability to increase sales to\\nexisting and new customers, continue to perform on existing contracts, develop and deploy new technologies, expand our marketing capabilities and sales\\norganization, and generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, volatility in the trading price of our Class A common stock, and our ability to\\ncomply with the covenants in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.\\nIf the market for our platforms and services develops more slowly than we expect, our growth may slow or stall, and our business, financial condition, and\\nresults of operations could be harmed.\\nThe market for our platforms is rapidly evolving. Our future success will depend in large part on the growth and expansion of this market, which is difficult to\\npredict and relies on a number of factors, including customer adoption, customer demand, changing customer needs, the entry of competitive products, the\\nsuccess of existing competitive products, potential customers’ willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data collection, storage, and processing and their\\nwillingness to invest in new software after significant prior investments in legacy data collection, storage, and processing software. The estimates and\\nassumptions that are used to calculate our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or\\npercentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates will pay for our platforms and services at all or generate any particular level of\\nrevenue for us. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow at the levels we expect\\nor at all for a variety of reasons outside our control, including competition in our industry. Further, if we or other data management and analytics providers\\nexperience security breaches or incidents, loss, corruption, or unavailability of or unauthorized access to customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other\\nproblems, this market as a whole, including our platforms, may be negatively affected. If software for the challenges that we address does not achieve\\nwidespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions\\n(including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and related economic sanctions, rising inflation and interest rates,\\nmonetary policy changes, or financial services sector instability), security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate\\nspending, or otherwise, or, alternatively, if the market develops but we are unable to continue to penetrate it due to the cost, performance, and perceived value\\nassociated with our platforms, or other factors, it could result in decreased revenue and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected.\\nWe will face risks associated with the growth of our business in new commercial markets and with new customer verticals, and we may neither be able to\\ncontinue our organic growth nor have the necessary resources to dedicate to the overall growth of our business.\\nWe plan to continue to expand our operations in new commercial markets, including those where we may have limited operating experience, and may be\\nsubject to increased business, technology and economic risks that could affect our financial results. In recent periods, we have increased our focus on\\ncommercial customers. In the future, we may increasingly focus on such customers, including in the banking, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical,\\nmanufacturing, telecommunication, automotive, airlines and aerospace, consumer packaged goods, insurance, retail, transportation, shipping and logistics,\\nenergy, mining, and other emerging industries. Entering new verticals and expanding in the verticals in which we are already operating will continue to require\\nsignificant resources and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful or beneficial to us. Historically, sales to new customers have often led to\\nadditional sales to the same customers or similarly situated customers. As we expand into and within new and emerging markets and heavily regulated industry\\nverticals, we will likely face additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and burdens from the governments and agencies which regulate those markets and industries.\\nWhile this approach to expansion within new commercial markets and verticals has proven successful in the past, it is uncertain we will achieve the same\\npenetration and organic growth in the future and our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\\n51\\nTable of contents\\nIn the future, we may not be able to secure the financing necessary to operate and grow our business as planned, or to make acquisitions.\\nIn the future, we may seek to raise or borrow additional funds to expand our product or business development efforts, make acquisitions or otherwise fund or\\ngrow our business and operations. During April 2021, we fully repaid the outstanding term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million and\\nmutually agreed with the lenders and other applicable parties under our revolving credit facility to amend our credit facility to, among other things, increase the\\ncommitments under the revolving credit facility by $200.0 million, for total revolving commitments of $400.0 million. In March 2022, our revolving credit\\nfacility was further amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the revolving loan facility and increase the commitments under the revolving\\ncredit facility by $100.0 million, and in July 2022, our revolving credit facility was further amended to, among other things, provide a new incremental DDTL\\ncommitment in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the credit agreement, as amended, with new and\\nexisting lenders. The DDTL commitment is available to draw upon through July 1, 2023 and any drawn amounts will mature on March 31, 2027. The existing\\nrevolving credit facility, as amended, matures in March 2027. The DDTL commitment together with our existing revolving commitments under our credit\\nfacility, as amended, provides for total commitments of up to $950.0 million, all of which are undrawn as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nAny interest or facility payments are due and payable quarterly or more or less frequently in certain circumstances. Additional equity or debt financing may not\\nbe available on favorable terms, or at all.\\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances, proceeds from option exercises, and payments\\nreceived from our customers. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least\\nthe next twelve months, we may require additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise\\nequity financing to fund operations or on an opportunistic basis, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. Additionally,\\nthere has recently been a tightening of the credit markets and rising interest rates, as well as instability in the financial services sector, which have negatively\\nimpacted the capital raising environment. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to, among other things:\\n•\\ndevelop new platforms, products, features, capabilities, and enhancements;\\n•\\ncontinue to expand our product development, sales, and marketing organizations;\\n•\\nrecruit, hire, train, and retain employees;\\n•\\nrespond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements; or\\n•\\npursue acquisition or other growth or investment opportunities.\\nOur inability to take any of these actions because adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms could have an adverse impact on our business, financial\\ncondition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\\nOur credit agreement and related documents, including our pledge and security agreements, contain, and instruments governing any future indebtedness of ours\\nwould likely contain, a number of covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to,\\namong other things:\\n•\\ncreate liens on certain assets;\\n•\\nincur additional debt;\\n•\\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\\n•\\nsell certain assets;\\n•\\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock;\\n•\\nplace restrictions on certain activities of subsidiaries;\\n•\\ntransact with our affiliates; and\\n•\\nuse a portion of our cash resources.\\nAny of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities. Any failure to comply\\nwith these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or instruments governing any future indebtedness of ours. Additionally, our credit facility\\nis secured by substantially all of our assets. Upon a default, unless waived, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments and\\ncease making further loans, and, when amounts are outstanding, foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our obligations under our credit\\n52\\nTable of contents\\nagreement and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a default under our credit facility could trigger a cross default under agreements governing\\nany future indebtedness. If we experience a default under our credit facility or instruments governing our future indebtedness, our business, financial condition,\\nand results of operations may be adversely impacted.\\nIn addition, a portion of our cash is pledged as cash collateral for letters of credit and bank guarantees which support certain of our real estate leases, customer\\ncontracts, and other guarantees and financing obligations. While these obligations remain outstanding and are cash collateralized, we do not have access to and\\ncannot use the pledged cash for our operations or to repay our other indebtedness. As of March 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants and\\nrestrictions associated with our credit facility.\\nVariable rate indebtedness that we may incur under our credit facility will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to\\nincrease significantly.\\nAs of March 31, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under our credit facility. Any borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates, which\\nexposes us to interest rate risk. Our loans under our credit facility would incur interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as administered by\\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or a successor administrator of the SOFR (or the applicable benchmark replacement) plus 2.00% or a base rate plus\\n1.00%, subject to certain adjustments, and is payable quarterly or more or less frequently in certain circumstances.\\nWe have invested in, and may in the future acquire or invest in, companies and technologies, which may divert our management’s attention, and result in\\nadditional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of\\nsuch acquisitions or investments. We are subject to risks associated with our investments, including a partial or complete loss of invested capital.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we have engaged in strategic transactions and alternative investments in the past and expect to evaluate and consider potential\\nstrategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. We also may enter\\ninto relationships with other businesses to complement or expand our products or our ability to provide services. An acquisition, investment or business\\nrelationship may result in unforeseen risks, operating difficulties and expenditures, including the following:\\n•\\nany such transactions may negatively affect our financial results because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities,\\nmay cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual\\nproperty claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to such transactions;\\n•\\ncosts and potential difficulties associated with the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business;\\n•\\nwe may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, infrastructure, products, personnel, or\\noperations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us or if we are unable to retain key\\npersonnel, if their technology is not easily adapted to work with ours, or if we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to\\nchanges in ownership, management, or otherwise;\\n•\\nwe may not realize the expected benefits of the transaction;\\n•\\nan acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses, result in unfavorable public perception, and distract our\\nmanagement;\\n•\\nan acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity\\nand effectiveness of service from either company;\\n•\\nthe potential impact on relationships with existing customers, vendors, and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another company or\\nbusiness that competes with or otherwise is incompatible with those existing relationships;\\n•\\nthe potential that our due diligence of the applicable company or business does not identify significant problems or liabilities, or that we underestimate the\\ncosts and effects of identified liabilities;\\n•\\nexposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, the transaction, including but not limited\\nto claims from former employees, customers, or other third parties, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces;\\n•\\npotential goodwill impairment charges related to acquisitions;\\n•\\nwe may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired products;\\n53\\nTable of contents\\n•\\nthe transaction may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or where competitors have\\nstronger market positions;\\n•\\nan acquisition may require us to comply with additional laws and regulations, or to engage in substantial remediation efforts to cause the acquired\\ncompany to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or result in liabilities resulting from the acquired company’s failure to comply with applicable\\nlaws or regulations;\\n•\\nour use of cash to pay for the transaction would limit other potential uses for our cash;\\n•\\nif we incur debt to fund such a transaction, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business as well as financial\\nmaintenance covenants; and\\n•\\nto the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with such transactions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings\\nper share may decrease.\\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments pursuant to certain approved agreements (“Investment Agreements”) to purchase, or commit to\\npurchase, shares of various entities, including special purpose acquisition companies and/or other privately-held or publicly-traded entities (each, an “Investee,”\\nand such purchases, the “Investments”); however, we do not currently anticipate entering into new Investment Agreements to purchase, or commit to purchase,\\nsecurities of special purpose acquisition companies. However, we have accepted, and may continue to accept, securities as noncash compensation.\\nAdditionally, in connection with approving and signing the Investment Agreements, we and each Investee or an associated entity entered into a commercial\\ncontract for access to our products and services (collectively, the “Strategic Commercial Contracts”). As of March 31, 2023, the terms of such Strategic\\nCommercial Contracts, including contractual options, range from two to seven years and are subject to termination for cause provisions. The total value of such\\nStrategic Commercial Contracts as of March 31, 2023 was $390.3 million, inclusive of $43.7 million of contractual options. When determining the total value\\nof these Strategic Commercial Contracts, we assess customers’ financial condition, including the consideration of their ability and intention to pay, and whether\\nall or some portion of the value of the contracts continue to meet the criteria for revenue recognition, among other factors. As a result of these assessments, the\\nabove $390.3 million of total value of Strategic Commercial Contracts excludes an aggregate of $102.4 million of the value of certain contracts when\\ncompared to the amounts as of December 31, 2022. Certain companies with which we have entered into commercial contracts have been, and may continue to\\nbe, unable to generate sufficient revenues or profitability or to access any necessary financing or funding in a timely manner or on favorable terms to them,\\nwhich has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our expected revenue and collections. These companies are generally engaged in\\nbusinesses that involve novel and unproven technologies, products, and services and such companies have been, and may continue to be, unable to perform all\\nor some of their obligations under any commercial contracts that we enter into with them in a timely manner or at all. For example, some of our early-stage\\nInvestee customers recently filed for bankruptcy, and the remaining value of the commercial contracts with such customers that is not expected to be\\nrecognized as revenue has been excluded from the total value of Strategic Commercial Contracts above. As of March 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of\\nrevenue recognized from Strategic Commercial Contracts was $200.1 million, of which $33.4 million was recognized by us during the three months ended\\nMarch 31, 2023.\\nOur ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our Investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations, including the requirement that\\noffers or sales of securities must be registered with the SEC pursuant to applicable laws or qualify for an exemption from such registration, and our ability to\\nliquidate and realize value from our Investments may be negatively and materially impacted by any delays or limitations on our ability to offer, sell, or transfer\\nour Investments. In addition, our Investments are speculative in nature and may be volatile or decline in value or be entirely lost. We have realized, and may\\ncontinue to realize, losses related to these equity securities, which could have a negative impact on our future financial position, results of operations, earnings\\nper share, and cash flows.\\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, we cannot\\nassure you that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities.\\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Data Privacy, and Security\\nIf any of the systems of any third parties upon which we rely, our customers’ cloud or on-premises environments, or our internal systems, are breached or\\nif unauthorized access to customer or third-party data is otherwise obtained, public perception of our platforms and O&M services may be harmed, and we\\nmay lose business and incur losses or liabilities.\\nOur success depends in part on our ability to provide effective data security protection in connection with our technology platforms and services, and we rely\\non information technology networks and systems to securely store, transmit, index, and otherwise process electronic information. Because our platforms and\\nservices are used by our customers to store, transmit, index, or otherwise process and analyze large data sets that often contain proprietary, confidential, and/or\\nsensitive information\\n54\\nTable of contents\\n(including in some instances personal or identifying information and personal health information), our software is perceived as an attractive target for attacks\\nby computer hackers or others seeking unauthorized access, and our software faces threats of unintended exposure, exfiltration, alteration, deletion, loss, or\\nunavailability of data. Additionally, because many of our customers use our platforms to store, transmit, and otherwise process proprietary, confidential, or\\nsensitive information, and complete mission critical tasks, they have a lower risk tolerance for security vulnerabilities in our platforms and services than for\\nvulnerabilities in other, less critical, software products and services.\\nOur platforms and services operate in conjunction with, and we are dependent upon, third-party products and components across a broad ecosystem, including\\nour customer environments. There have been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or\\nany third-party providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of\\nor disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support or otherwise interface with us and our platforms and\\nservices. If there is a security vulnerability, error, or other bug in one of these third-party products or components and if there is a security exploit targeting\\nthem, we could face increased costs, claims, liability, reduced revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive position. The natural sunsetting or phasing\\nout of third-party products and operating systems that we use requires that our infrastructure teams reallocate time and attention to migration and updates,\\nduring which period potential security vulnerabilities could be exploited. In addition, our software is deployed on-premises at customer sites and in other\\nlocations where we may not have full control over how our products are deployed or managed. If our products are not appropriately secured in these\\nenvironments, they could be compromised, inappropriately accessed, or undergo unauthorized copying and distribution, which could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, as we increase the number of customers we serve on our cloud environment, the likelihood\\nincreases that some usage of our products may occur that violates our terms of service or is otherwise improper or perceived as improper, which could cause\\nreputational damage and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nWe, and the third-party vendors upon which we rely, have experienced, and may in the future experience, cybersecurity attacks and threats, including threats or\\nattempts to disrupt our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive or confidential information. Our and our\\nthird-party vendors’ technology systems may be damaged, disrupted, or compromised by malicious events, such as cyberattacks (including computer viruses,\\nransomware, and other malicious and destructive code, phishing attacks, and denial of service attacks), physical or electronic security breaches and incidents,\\nnatural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, personnel misconduct, and human error. Such attacks or security breaches or incidents may be\\nperpetrated by internal bad actors, such as employees or contractors, or by third parties (including traditional computer hackers, persons involved with\\norganized crime, or foreign state or foreign state-supported actors). Cybersecurity threats can employ a wide variety of methods and techniques, may include\\nthe use of social engineering techniques or supply-chain attacks, are constantly evolving, and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, all of\\nwhich increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or\\nsabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until after they are launched against a target, we and our third-party vendors may not have\\nthe capacity to immediately detect such efforts, may be unable to anticipate these techniques, or may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures.\\nAlthough prior known cyberattacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results, and we are continuing to bolster our threat detection\\nand mitigation processes and procedures, we cannot guarantee that past, future, or ongoing cyberattacks or other security breaches or incidents against us or a\\nthird party, if successful, will not have a material impact on our business or financial results, whether directly or indirectly. For instance, due to political\\nuncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and military actions associated with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, we and our third-party vendors have been\\nvulnerable to a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks, phishing attacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking or similar breaches and incidents from\\nnation-state actors or affiliated actors, including attacks that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell, and\\ndistribute our products and services. While we have security measures in place to protect our information and our customers’ information and to prevent data\\nloss and other security breaches and incidents, we have not always been able to do so and there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to\\nanticipate or prevent security breaches or incidents, or unauthorized access of our information technology systems or the information technology systems of the\\nthird-party vendors upon which we rely. Despite our implementation of network security measures and internal information security policies, data stored on\\npersonnel computer systems is also vulnerable to similar security breaches and incidents, unauthorized tampering or human error.\\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security breaches or incidents involving certain types of data, including\\npersonal data. In addition, most of our customers, including U.S. government customers, contractually require us to notify them of certain data security\\nbreaches and incidents. If an actual or perceived breach of security measures, unauthorized access to our system or the systems of the third-party vendors that\\nwe rely upon, or any other cybersecurity attack, threat, or incident occurs, we may face direct or indirect liability, costs, or damages, contract termination, our\\nreputation in the industry and with current and potential customers may be compromised, our ability to attract new customers could be negatively affected, and\\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\n55\\nTable of contents\\nFurther, unauthorized access to our or our third-party vendors’ information technology systems or data or other security breaches or incidents could result in the\\nloss, corruption, or unavailability of information; significant remediation costs; litigation, disputes, regulatory action, or investigations that could result in\\ndamages, material fines, and penalties; indemnity obligations; interruptions in the operation of our business, including our ability to provide new product\\nfeatures, new platforms, or services to our customers; damage to our operation technology networks and information technology systems; and other liabilities.\\nMoreover, our remediation efforts may not be successful. Any or all of these issues, or the perception that any of them have occurred, could negatively affect\\nour ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to terminate or not renew their agreements, hinder our ability to obtain and maintain required or\\ndesirable cybersecurity certifications, and result in reputational damage, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial\\ncondition, and future prospects. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our license arrangements with customers or in our\\nagreements with vendors, partners, or others would be enforceable, applicable, or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages\\nwith respect to any particular claim.\\nWe maintain cybersecurity insurance and other types of insurance, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, but our insurance may not be sufficient to\\ncover all costs associated with a potential data security incident. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for\\ncyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large\\nclaims or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available\\ninsurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance\\nrequirements, could harm our financial condition.\\nIssues raised by the use of AI (including machine learning) in our platforms may result in reputational harm or liability.\\nAI is enabled by or integrated into some of our technology platforms and is a significant and growing element of our business. As with many developing\\ntechnologies, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be\\nflawed. Datasets in AI training, development, or operations may be insufficient, of poor quality, or reflect unwanted forms of bias. Inappropriate or\\ncontroversial data practices by, or practices reflecting inherent biases of, data scientists, engineers, and end-users of our systems could impair the acceptance of\\nAI solutions. Third-party AI capabilities that can be integrated with our platforms could also produce false or “hallucinatory” inferences about customer data or\\nenterprises, or other information or subject matter. If the recommendations, forecasts, or analyses that AI applications assist in producing are deficient or\\ninaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as\\nthe European Union (“EU”), and brand or reputational harm.\\nSome AI scenarios present ethical issues, and the enablement or integration of AI into our platforms may subject us to new or heightened legal, regulatory,\\nethical, or other challenges. Our technologies and business practices are designed to mitigate many of these risks. For example, our platforms include data\\ngovernance tools and machine learning modeling tools which help to regulate and limit user access to data sets and develop, deploy, and manage more effective\\nand responsible AI capabilities. However, if these controls are not properly implemented by, or for, our customers, or if we enable or offer AI solutions that are\\ncontroversial or problematic because of their purported or real impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand\\nor reputational harm, as well as regulatory or legal scrutiny.\\nWe depend on computing infrastructure operated by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Microsoft, and other third parties to support some of our customers\\nand any errors, disruption, performance problems, or failure in their or our operational infrastructure could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition, and results of operations.\\nWe rely on the technology, infrastructure, and software applications, including software-as-a-service offerings, of certain third parties, such as AWS and\\nMicrosoft Azure, in order to host or operate some or all of certain key technology platform features or functions of our business, including our cloud-based\\nservices (including Palantir Cloud, as defined in the section titled “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations—Components of Results of Operations”), customer relationship management activities, billing and order management, and financial accounting\\nservices. Additionally, we rely on computer hardware purchased in order to deliver our platforms and services. We do not have control over the operations of\\nthe facilities of the third parties that we use. If any of these third-party services experience errors, disruptions, security issues, or other performance\\ndeficiencies, if they are updated such that our platforms become incompatible, if these services, software, or hardware fail or become unavailable due to\\nextended outages, interruptions, defects, or otherwise, or if they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices (or at all), these issues\\ncould result in errors or defects in our platforms, cause our platforms to fail, our revenue and margins could decline, or our reputation and brand could be\\ndamaged, we could be exposed to legal or contractual liability, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our operations could be interrupted, and our\\nprocesses for managing our sales and servicing our customers could be impaired until equivalent services or technology, if available, are identified, procured,\\nand implemented, all of which may take significant time and resources, increase our costs, and could adversely affect our business. Many of these third-party\\nproviders attempt to impose limitations on their liability for such errors, disruptions, defects, performance deficiencies, or failures, and if\\n56\\nTable of contents\\nenforceable, we may have additional liability to our customers which may not be compensated by our third-party providers which are responsible for the\\nliability.\\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, failures, data loss, corruption, unavailability, outages, and other performance problems\\nwith our infrastructure or cloud-based offerings due to a variety of factors, which have included or may in the future include infrastructure changes,\\nintroductions of new functionality, human or software errors, employee misconduct, capacity constraints, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, computer\\nviruses, ransomware, and other malicious or destructive code, or other security-related incidents, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for\\nall situations. If we experience disruptions, failures, data loss, outages, or other performance problems, our business, financial condition, and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nOur systems and the third-party systems upon which we and our customers rely are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences\\nsuch as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, cybersecurity threats, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, public health crises such as\\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions such as those that may be caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, or acts of misconduct.\\nMoreover, we have business operations in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is a seismically active region. Despite any precautions we may take, the\\noccurrence of a catastrophic event or other unanticipated problems at our or our third-party vendors’ hosting facilities, or within our systems or the systems of\\nthird parties upon which we rely, could result in interruptions, performance problems, or failure of our infrastructure, technology, or platforms, which may\\nadversely impact our business. In addition, our ability to conduct normal business operations could be severely affected. In the event of significant physical\\ndamage to one of these facilities, it may take a significant period of time to achieve full resumption of our services, and our disaster recovery planning may not\\naccount for all eventualities. In addition, any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our\\nbusiness.\\nFurthermore, our platforms are in many cases important or essential to our customers’ operations, including in some cases, their cybersecurity or oversight and\\ncompliance programs, and subject to service level agreements (“SLAs”). Any interruption in our service, whether as a result of an internal or third-party issue,\\ncould damage our brand and reputation, cause our customers to terminate or not renew their contracts with us or decrease use of our platforms and services,\\nrequire us to indemnify our customers against certain losses, result in our issuing credit or paying penalties or fines, subject us to other losses or liabilities,\\ncause our platforms to be perceived as unreliable or unsecure, and prevent us from gaining new or additional business from current or future customers, any of\\nwhich could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nMoreover, to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and\\nnetwork architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected. The provisioning of additional cloud hosting capacity requires lead time. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and other third parties have no obligation\\nto renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If AWS, Microsoft Azure, or other third parties increase pricing terms, terminate\\nor seek to terminate our contractual relationship, establish more favorable relationships with our competitors, or change or interpret their terms of service or\\npolicies in a manner that is unfavorable to us, we may be required to transfer to other cloud providers or invest in a private cloud. If we are required to transfer\\nto other cloud providers or invest in a private cloud, we could incur significant costs and experience possible service interruption in connection with doing so,\\nor risk loss of customer contracts if they are unwilling to accept such a change.\\nA failure to maintain our relationships with our third-party providers (or obtain adequate replacements), and to receive services from such providers that do not\\ncontain any material errors or defects, could adversely affect our ability to deliver effective products and solutions to our customers and adversely affect our\\nbusiness and results of operations.\\nOur policies regarding customer confidential information and support for individual privacy and civil liberties could cause us to experience adverse\\nbusiness and reputational consequences.\\nWe strive to protect our customers’ confidential information and individuals’ privacy interests consistent with applicable laws, directives, and regulations.\\nConsequently, we do not provide information about our customers to third parties without legal process. From time to time, government entities may seek our\\nassistance with obtaining information about our customers or could request that we modify our technology platforms in a manner to permit access or\\nmonitoring. In light of our confidentiality and privacy commitments, we may legally challenge law enforcement or other government requests to provide\\ninformation, to obtain encryption keys, or to modify or weaken encryption. To the extent that we do not provide assistance to or comply with requests from\\ngovernment entities, or if we challenge those requests publicly or in court, we may experience adverse political, business, and reputational consequences\\namong certain customers or portions of the public. Conversely, to the extent that we do provide such assistance, or do not challenge those requests publicly in\\ncourt, we may experience adverse political, business, and reputational consequences from other customers or portions of the public arising from concerns over\\nprivacy or the government’s activities.\\n57\\nTable of contents\\nFailure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could adversely affect our business.\\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under a combination of\\npatent and other intellectual property and proprietary rights in the United States and other jurisdictions outside the United States so that we can prevent others\\nfrom using our inventions and proprietary information and technology. Despite our efforts, third parties may attempt to disclose, obtain, copy, or use our\\nintellectual property or other proprietary information or technology without our authorization, and our efforts to protect our intellectual property and other\\nproprietary rights may not prevent such unauthorized disclosure or use, misappropriation, infringement, reverse engineering or other violation of our\\nintellectual property or other proprietary rights. Effective protection of our rights may not be available to us in every country in which our technology platforms\\nor services are available. The laws of some countries may not be as protective of intellectual property and other proprietary rights as those in the United States,\\nand mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property and other proprietary rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or\\nthe need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third\\nparties from using our intellectual property or other proprietary information or technology.\\nIn addition, we may be the subject of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims, which could be very time-consuming and expensive to\\nsettle or litigate and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages if we\\nare found to have infringed patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights, or breached trademark co-existence agreements or other\\nintellectual property licenses and could require us to cease using or to rebrand all or portions of our platforms. Any of our patents, copyrights, trademarks, or\\nother intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.\\nWhile we have issued patents and patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent\\napplications or such patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. Furthermore, the patent prosecution process is\\nexpensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain, and enforce all necessary or desirable patent\\napplications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. The scope of patent protection also can be reinterpreted after issuance and issued patents may be\\ninvalidated. Even if our patent applications do issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that is sufficiently broad to protect our technology, prevent\\ncompetitors or other third parties from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Even if our patents issue in a form that\\ncovers our technology, enforcing patents against suspected infringers is time consuming, expensive, and involves risks associated with litigation, including the\\nrisk the suspected infringers file counterclaims against us.\\nIn addition, any of our patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held\\nunenforceable, or circumvented in litigation or other proceedings, including, where applicable, opposition, re-examination, inter partes review, post-grant\\nreview, interference, nullification and derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, and such intellectual property or other\\nproprietary rights may be lost or no longer provide us meaningful competitive advantages. Such proceedings may result in substantial cost and require\\nsignificant time from our management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Third parties also may legitimately and independently develop products,\\nservices, and technology similar to or duplicative of our platforms. In addition to protection under intellectual property laws, we rely on confidentiality or\\nlicense agreements that we generally enter into with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, advisors, vendors, and customers, and generally limit\\naccess to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may\\nhave or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached or challenged, or that such breaches\\nwill be detected. Furthermore, non-disclosure provisions can be difficult to enforce, and even if successfully enforced, may not be entirely effective.\\nAdditionally, as more information about us and our platforms is made or becomes publicly available, it may be more difficult to manage actions by third parties\\nwith respect to, or other use of, such information. We cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent infringement, misappropriation, or\\nother violation of our technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Because we may be an attractive target for cyberattacks, we also may have\\na heightened risk of unauthorized access to, and misappropriation of, our proprietary and competitively sensitive information. We may be required to spend\\nsignificant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and we may conclude that in at least some instances the\\nbenefits of protecting our intellectual property or other proprietary rights may be outweighed by the expense or distraction to our management. We may initiate\\nclaims or litigation against third parties for infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights or to\\nestablish the validity of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Any such litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could be time-\\nconsuming, result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Furthermore, attempts to enforce our\\nintellectual property rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result\\nin a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part.\\n58\\nTable of contents\\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay\\nsignificant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\\nOur success and ability to compete also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual\\nproperty or other proprietary rights of third parties. Companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential\\ncompetitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently pursue litigation based on allegations of infringement,\\nmisappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantial resources to\\nenforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Such litigation also may involve non-practicing patent\\nassertion entities or companies who use their patents as a means to extract license fees by threatening costly litigation or that have minimal operations or\\nrelevant product revenue and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence or protection. We have received notices, and may continue to\\nreceive notices in the future, that claim we have infringed, misappropriated, misused or otherwise violated other parties’ intellectual property rights, and, to the\\nextent we have made or will make more information about our platforms publicly available and become exposed to greater visibility, we face a higher risk of\\nbeing the subject of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation claims, which is not uncommon with respect to software\\ntechnologies in particular. There may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued patents or pending patent applications, that cover significant\\naspects of our technologies, or business methods. There may also be third-party intellectual property rights, including trademark registrations and pending\\napplications, that cover the goods and services that we offer in certain regions. We may also be exposed to increased risk of being the subject of intellectual\\nproperty infringement, misappropriation, or other violation claims as a result of acquisitions and our incorporation of open source and other third-party\\nsoftware into, or new branding for, our technology platforms, as, among other things, we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with\\nrespect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement, misappropriation, or other violation risks. In addition, former employers of our\\ncurrent, former, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these\\nformer employers. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, are difficult to predict, could be very time-consuming and expensive to settle or\\nlitigate, could divert our management’s attention and other resources, and may not be covered by the insurance that we carry. These claims could subject us to\\nsignificant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights.\\nThese claims could also result in our having to stop using technology, branding or marks found to be in violation of a third party’s rights and any necessary\\nrebranding could result in the loss of goodwill. We could be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially\\nreasonable terms or at all. Even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our expenses. As a result,\\nwe could be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, branding or marks, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot\\nlicense rights or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of one or more of our platforms or\\nfeatures, we could lose existing customers, and we may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would harm our business, financial condition,\\nand results of operations.\\nFurther, our agreements with customers and other third parties generally include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses\\nsuffered or incurred as a result of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights,\\ndamages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platforms, services, or other contractual obligations. Large\\nindemnity payments could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could\\nhave adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.\\nReal or perceived errors, failures, defects, or bugs in our platforms could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\\nBecause we offer very complex technology platforms, undetected errors, defects, failures, or bugs have occurred and may in the future occur, especially when\\nplatforms or capabilities are first introduced or when new versions or other product or infrastructure updates are released. Our platforms are often installed and\\nused in large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, software products and equipment, and data source and network configurations,\\nwhich may cause errors or failures in our platforms or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our platforms. Despite testing by us, errors, failures, or\\nbugs may not be found in new software or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments. Errors, failures, defects, and bugs have affected the\\nperformance of our platforms and can also delay the development or release of new platforms or capabilities or new versions of platforms, adversely affect our\\nreputation and our customers’ willingness to buy platforms from us, and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our platforms. Many of our\\ncustomers use our platforms in applications that are critical to their businesses or missions and may have a lower risk tolerance to defects in our platforms than\\nto defects in other, less critical, software products. Any errors or delays in releasing new software or new versions of platforms, allegations of unsatisfactory\\nperformance, or real or perceived errors, defects, or failures in released software could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs,\\ncause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the software, cause us to lose significant customers, cause us to issue credits or refunds, subject us to liability\\nfor\\n59\\nTable of contents\\ndamages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\\ncondition. In addition, our platforms could be perceived to be ineffective for a variety of reasons outside of our control. Hackers or other malicious parties\\ncould circumvent our or our customers’ security measures, and customers may misuse our platforms resulting in a security breach or perceived product failure.\\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our platforms and services, or dissatisfaction with our services and outcomes, could result in customer\\nterminations and/or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or we have chosen, or in the future may choose,\\nfor customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct any such errors, failures, or bugs. Although we have limitation of\\nliability provisions in our standard software licensing and service agreement terms and conditions, these provisions may not be enforceable in some\\ncircumstances, may vary in levels of protection across our agreements, or may not fully or effectively protect us from such claims and related liabilities and\\ncosts. We generally provide a warranty for our software products and services and an SLA for our performance of software operations. In the event that there is\\na failure of warranties in such agreements, we are generally obligated to correct the product or service to conform to the warranty provision, or, if we are unable\\nto do so, the customer is entitled to seek a refund of the purchase price of the product and service (generally prorated over the contract term). In the event of a\\nviolation of an SLA, some customers may be entitled to seek a refund of a portion of the applicable monthly fee, with such portion determined by the\\nmagnitude of SLA violation, subject to a cap of a portion of total monthly fees, as applicable. The sale and support of our products also entail the risk of\\nproduct liability claims. We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not\\nadequately cover any claim asserted against us. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation\\nand divert management’s time and other resources.\\nIn addition, our platforms integrate a wide variety of other elements, and our platforms must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors and\\nour customers’ internally developed software. As a result, when problems occur for a customer using our platforms, it may be difficult to identify the sources of\\nthese problems, and we may receive blame for a security, access control, or other compliance breach that was the result of the failure of one of the other\\nelements in a customer’s or another vendor’s IT, security, or compliance infrastructure. The occurrence of software or errors in data, whether or not caused by\\nour platforms, could delay or reduce market acceptance of our platforms and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance, and any\\nnecessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any such problems could harm our business, financial condition, and results\\nof operations. If an actual or perceived breach of information correctness, auditability, integrity, or availability occurs in one of our customers’ systems,\\nregardless of whether the breach is attributable to our platforms, the market perception of the effectiveness of our platforms could be harmed. Alleviating any\\nof these problems could require additional significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays, or cessation of our\\nproduct licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\\noperations, and growth prospects.\\nWe rely on the availability of licenses to third-party technology that may be difficult to replace or that may cause errors or delay implementation of our\\nplatforms and services should we not be able to continue or obtain a commercially reasonable license to such technology.\\nOur technology platforms include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating\\nto various aspects of these platforms or to seek new licenses for existing or new platforms or other products. There can be no assurance that the necessary\\nlicenses would be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Third parties may terminate their licenses with us for a variety of reasons, including\\nactual or perceived failures or breaches of security or privacy, or reputational concerns, or they may choose not to renew their licenses with us. In addition, we\\nmay be subject to liability if third-party software that we license is found to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate intellectual property or privacy rights\\nof others. The loss of, or inability to obtain, certain third-party licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to\\nengage in litigation regarding these matters, could result in product roll-backs, delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed\\nor developed, if at all, and integrated into our platforms, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nMoreover, the inclusion in our platforms of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to\\ndifferentiate our platforms from products of our competitors and could inhibit our ability to provide the current level of service to existing customers.\\nIn addition, any data that we license from third parties for potential use in our platforms may contain errors or defects, which could negatively impact the\\nanalytics that our customers perform on or with such data. This may have a negative impact on how our platforms are perceived by our current and potential\\ncustomers and could materially damage our reputation and brand.\\nChanges in or the loss of third-party licenses could lead to our platforms becoming inoperable or the performance of our platforms being materially reduced\\nresulting in our potentially needing to incur additional research and development costs to\\n60\\nTable of contents\\nensure continued performance of our platforms or a material increase in the costs of licensing, and we may experience decreased demand for our platforms.\\nOur platforms contain “open source” software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively\\naffect our business.\\nOur technology platforms are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under “open source” licenses. Some of these licenses\\ncontain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we\\nlicense these modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further\\nuse. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain provisions of the open source licenses, be\\nrequired to release the source code of our proprietary software. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to\\ngreater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide updates, warranties, support, indemnities,\\nassurances of title, or controls on origin of the software, and are provided on an “as-is” basis. Likewise, some open source projects have known security and\\nother vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities, or are otherwise subject to security attacks due to their wide availability, and are provided on an “as-is”\\nbasis. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organization for the\\nuse of open source software, and the use of software tools to review our source code for open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source\\nsoftware is submitted for approval prior to use in our platforms or that such software tools will be effective. In addition, open source license terms may be\\nambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect\\nour business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our platforms, to release proprietary\\nsource code, to discontinue the sale of our platforms in the event re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to take other remedial action\\nthat may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\\ngrowth prospects. In addition, if the open source software we use is no longer maintained by the relevant open source community, then it may be more difficult\\nto make the necessary revisions to our software, including modifications to address security vulnerabilities, which could impact our ability to mitigate\\ncybersecurity risks or fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers. We may also face claims from copyright owners seeking to enforce the terms of an\\nopen source license governing the software, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works or our proprietary source code that\\nwas developed using such software. Such claims, with or without merit, could result in litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to settle or litigation,\\nincluding copyright infringement claims, could divert our management’s attention and other resources, could require us to lease some of our proprietary code,\\nor could require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our software, any of which could adversely affect our business.\\nAdditionally, we have intentionally made certain proprietary software available on an open source basis, both by contributing modifications back to existing\\nopen source projects, and by making certain internally developed tools available pursuant to open source licenses, and we plan to continue to do so in the\\nfuture. While we have established procedures, including a review process for any such contributions, which is designed to protect any code that may be\\ncompetitively sensitive, we cannot guarantee that this process has always been applied consistently. Even when applied, because any software source code we\\ncontribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such software source code may be\\nlimited or lost entirely, and we may be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code for competitive purposes,\\nor for commercial or other purposes beyond what we intended.\\nMany of these risks associated with usage of open source software could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively\\naffect the performance of our offerings and our business.\\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory, and Accounting\\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and security, technology\\nprotection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes\\nto our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, national, and international laws, directives, and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters\\ncentral to our business, including privacy and data protection, data security, data storage, retention, transfer and deletion, technology protection, and personal\\ninformation. International data protection, data security, privacy, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than\\nthose in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which, depending on the regime, may be enforced by private parties\\nor government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change, and they are likely to continue to develop and evolve for the\\nforeseeable future. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and\\nrapidly evolving software and technology industry in which we operate, and\\n61\\nTable of contents\\nmay be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. A number of proposals are\\npending before U.S. federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business. For example, despite recent\\ndevelopments including an in-principle agreement between the United States and the European Commission and a subsequent Executive Order directing the\\nsteps that the United States will take to implement the U.S. commitments under the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, new legal challenges to the\\nmechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to certain other jurisdictions, including the United States, could\\nemerge, resulting in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders. The California state legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy\\nAct (“CCPA”) in 2018 and California voters approved a ballot measure subsequently establishing the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) in 2020, which\\nregulate the processing of personal information of California residents and increase the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal\\ninformation of California residents, including requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and affords such consumers\\nnew abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring\\nenforcement actions, with penalties for violations of the CCPA. The CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023 instilling enforcement authority in a new\\ndedicated regulatory body, the California Privacy Protection Agency, which will begin carrying out enforcement actions as soon as six months after the\\nenactment date. While aspects of both the CCPA and CPRA and their interpretations remain to be determined in practice, we are committed to complying with\\ntheir applicable obligations. More generally, some observers have noted the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy\\nlegislation in the United States, as observed with the subsequent adoption of state-level comprehensive consumer privacy legislation, including the following\\n(collectively, the “State Privacy Laws”):\\n•\\nthe Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which was enacted in March 2021 and became effective on January 1, 2023;\\n•\\nthe Colorado Privacy Act, which was enacted in June 2021, and will become effective on July 1, 2023;\\n•\\nthe Utah Consumer Privacy Act, which was enacted in March 2022, and will become effective December 31, 2023;\\n•\\nConnecticut’s Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring, which was enacted in May 2022 and most of which will become\\neffective July 1, 2023; and\\n•\\nIowa’s Act Relating to Consumer Data Protection, which was enacted in March 2023 and will become effective January 1, 2025.\\nWe cannot yet fully assess the impact of the State Privacy Laws and other new laws or regulations on our business or operations, but developments regarding\\nthese and all privacy and data protection laws and regulations around the world may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur\\nsubstantial costs and expenses in an effort to maintain compliance on an ongoing basis. Outside of the United States, virtually every jurisdiction in which we\\noperate has established its own legal framework relating to privacy, data protection, and information security matters with which we and/or our customers must\\ncomply. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, retention, disclosure, security, transfer, and other processing of\\ndata that identifies or may be used to identify or locate an individual. Some countries and regions, including the EU, are considering or have passed legislation\\nthat imposes significant obligations in connection with privacy, data protection, and information security that could increase the cost and complexity of\\ndelivering our platforms and services, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which took effect in May 2018. Complying with\\nthe GDPR or other data protection laws, directives, and regulations as they emerge may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify\\nour data handling practices on an ongoing basis. Non-compliance with the GDPR specifically may result in administrative fines or monetary penalties of up to\\n4% of worldwide annual revenue in the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements, and could result in\\nproceedings against us by governmental entities or other related parties and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of\\noperations.\\nAdditionally, post-Brexit updates to United Kingdom (“U.K.”) data protection laws and regulations, while largely conforming to EU GDPR standards paving\\nthe way for a 2021 European Commission adequacy determination for export of personal data from the European Economic Area to the U.K., may change over\\ntime as the U.K. and its regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office, continue to examine its global market standing. Modifications in the standards for\\nvalid data transfer to the U.S. from the U.K., the EU, Switzerland, and other countries using standard contractual clauses or similar mechanisms may further\\nrequire us to change our product and business practices, as well as to update client agreements in ways that introduce additional costs to our business.\\nThe overarching complexity of laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security around the world pose a compliance\\nchallenge that could manifest in costs, damages, or liability in other forms as a result of failure to implement proper programmatic controls, failure to adhere to\\nthose controls or to the commitments we make, or the malicious or inadvertent breach of applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual privacy or data protection\\nrequirements by us, our employees, our business partners, or our customers.\\n62\\nTable of contents\\nIn addition to government regulation, self-regulatory standards and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, be argued to apply to us,\\nor we may elect to comply with such standards or to facilitate our customers’ compliance with such standards. Because privacy, data protection, and\\ninformation security are critical competitive factors in our industry, we may make statements on our website, in marketing materials, or in other settings about\\nour data security measures and our compliance with, or our ability to facilitate our customers’ compliance with, these standards. We also expect that there will\\ncontinue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection, and information security, and we cannot yet determine the impact such\\nfuture laws, regulations and standards, or amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, industry standards, or other obligations may\\nhave on our business. New laws, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, industry standards, and contractual and other obligations\\nmay require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. As these legal regimes relating to privacy, data protection, and information security\\ncontinue to evolve, they may result in ever-increasing public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Furthermore, because the\\ninterpretation and application of laws, standards, contractual obligations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security are\\nuncertain, these laws, standards, and contractual and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is, or is alleged to be, inconsistent with\\nour data management practices, our policies or procedures, or the features of our platforms, or we may simply fail to properly develop or implement our\\npractices, policies, procedures, or features in compliance with such obligations. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, and other claims, we could\\nbe required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our platforms, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We may\\nbe unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to fulfill existing obligations, make\\nenhancements, or develop new platforms and features could be limited. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws,\\nregulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our\\nplatforms.\\nThese existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can make our platforms and services less effective or valuable, delay or\\nimpede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require us to modify our data handling practices, limit our\\noperations, impose substantial fines and penalties, require significant management time and attention, or put our data or technology at risk. Any failure or\\nperceived failure by us or our platforms to comply with the laws, regulations, directives, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations of the United States,\\nEU, or other governmental or non-governmental bodies at the regional, national, or supra-national level relating to privacy, data protection, or information\\nsecurity, or any security incident that results in actual or suspected loss of or the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, use, release, or transfer of, personal\\ninformation, personal data, or other customer or sensitive data or information may result in governmental investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions and\\nprosecutions, private claims and litigation, indemnification or other contractual obligations, other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease\\nexisting business practices, or adverse publicity, and related costs and liabilities, which could significantly and adversely affect our business and results of\\noperations.\\nOur non-U.S. sales and operations subject us to additional risks and regulations that can adversely affect our results of operations.\\nOur successes to date have primarily come from customers in relatively stable and developed countries, but we are in the process of entering new and emerging\\nmarkets in non-U.S. countries, including with COVID-19 response efforts and defense, law enforcement, national security, and other government agencies, as\\npart of our growth strategy. These new and emerging markets may involve uncertain business, technology, and economic risks and may be difficult or\\nimpossible for us to penetrate, even if we were to commit significant resources to do so.\\nWe currently have sales personnel and sales and services operations in the United States and certain countries around the world. To the extent that we\\nexperience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, or retaining non-U.S. staff, and specifically sales management and sales personnel staff, we may\\nexperience difficulties in sales productivity in, or market penetration of, non-U.S. markets. Our ability to convince customers to expand their use of our\\nplatforms or renew their subscription, license, or maintenance and service agreements with us is correlated to, among other things, our direct engagement with\\nthe customer. To the extent we are restricted or unable to engage with non-U.S. customers effectively with our limited sales force and services capacity, we may\\nbe unable to grow sales to existing customers to the same degree we have experienced in the United States.\\nOur non-U.S. operations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including:\\n•\\nincreased management, travel, infrastructure, and legal and financial compliance costs and time associated with having multiple non-U.S. operations,\\nincluding but not limited to compliance with local employment laws and other applicable laws and regulations;\\n•\\nlonger payment cycles, greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, especially in emerging markets, and the\\nlikelihood that revenue from non-U.S. system integrators, government contractors, and customers may need to be recognized when cash is received, at\\nleast until satisfactory payment history has been established, or upon confirmation of certain acceptance criteria or milestones;\\n63\\nTable of contents\\n•\\nthe need to adapt our platforms for non-U.S. customers whether to accommodate customer preferences or local law;\\n•\\ndiffering regulatory and legal requirements and possible enactment of additional regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or re-export of our platforms\\nor the provision of services, which could delay, restrict, or prevent the sale or use of our platforms and services in some jurisdictions;\\n•\\ncompliance with multiple and changing foreign laws and regulations, including those governing employment, privacy, data protection, information\\nsecurity, data transfer, and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations;\\n•\\nnew and different sources of competition not present in the United States;\\n•\\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may cause us to\\nwithdraw from particular markets, or impact financial results and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements;\\n•\\nvolatility in non-U.S. political and economic environments, including by way of examples, the potential effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and\\nthe ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as economic sanctions the United States and other countries have imposed on Russia;\\n•\\nweaker protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and the risk of potential theft, copying, or other compromises of our technology, data, or\\nintellectual property in connection with our non-U.S. operations, whether by state-sponsored malfeasance or other foreign entities or individuals;\\n•\\nvolatility and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including that, because many of our non-U.S. contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase\\nin the strength of the U.S. dollar has made our products more expensive for non-U.S. dollar denominated customers, which may make doing business with\\nus less appealing to such customers;\\n•\\nmanagement and employee communication and integration problems resulting from language differences, cultural differences, and geographic dispersion;\\n•\\ndifficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from, or converting currencies in, certain countries;\\n•\\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including multiple and possibly overlapping tax regimes, the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems, and\\nchanges in tax laws;\\n•\\nlack of familiarity with local laws, customs, and practices, and laws and business practices favoring local competitors or partners; and\\n•\\ninterruptions to our business operations and our customers’ business operations subject to events such as war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters,\\npublic health concerns or epidemics (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), shortages or failures of power, internet, telecommunications, or hosting\\nservice providers, cyberattacks or malicious acts, or responses to these events.\\nIn addition to the factors above, foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to\\nsell our platforms in certain countries. For example, foreign governments may require a percentage of prime contracts be fulfilled by local contractors or\\nprovide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours. Moreover, both the\\nU.S. government and foreign governments may regulate the acquisition of or import of our technologies or our entry into certain foreign markets or partnership\\nwith foreign third parties through investment screening or other regulations. Such regulations may apply to certain non-U.S. joint ventures, platform\\npartnerships, and strategic alliances that may be integral to our long-term business strategy.\\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our non-U.S. operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to\\nkeep current with changes in foreign government requirements and laws as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could\\nsubject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, or other collateral\\nconsequences. In many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or\\nU.S. regulations applicable to us. In addition, although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and\\npolicies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, partners, and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or\\nkey control policies by our employees, contractors, partners, or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements,\\ngovernmental sanctions, fines, penalties, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our platforms. In addition, responding to any action may result\\nin a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions or failure to prevail\\nin any possible civil or criminal litigation could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\\n64\\nTable of contents\\nAlso, we are expanding operations, including our work with existing commercial customers, into countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere,\\nwhich may place restrictions on the transfer of data and potentially the import and use of foreign encryption technology. Any of these risks could harm our non-\\nU.S. operations and reduce our non-U.S. sales, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\\nSome of our business partners also have non-U.S. operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks\\nof our own non-U.S. operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business, and we have been, and expect to be, the subject of legal and\\nregulatory inquiries, which may result in monetary payments or may otherwise negatively impact our reputation, business, and results of operations.\\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in which we operate. In certain jurisdictions, the regulatory\\nrequirements imposed by foreign governments may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or\\nrequirements could subject us to investigations, administrative proceedings, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, litigation,\\ncivil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, exclusion from sales channels or sales opportunities, injunctions, or other consequences. Such matters\\nmay include, but are not limited to, claims, disputes, allegations, or investigations related to alleged violations of laws or regulations relating to anti-corruption\\nrequirements, lobbying or conflict-of-interest requirements, export or other trade controls, data privacy or data protection requirements, or laws or regulations\\nrelating to employment, procurement, cybersecurity, securities, or antitrust/competition requirements. The effects of recently imposed and proposed actions are\\nuncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental action and responses. For example, governmental bodies have implemented laws and are considering\\nfurther regulation of AI (including machine learning), which could negatively impact our ability to use and develop platforms and products incorporating these\\ntechnologies. The EU has proposed certain legislation that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations related to the use of AI-related systems. If such\\nlegislation, or similar regulations in other jurisdictions, is enacted, compliance with such obligations may be difficult, onerous, and costly, and could adversely\\naffect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\\nWe may be subject to government inquiries that drain our time and resources, tarnish our brand among customers and potential customers, prevent us from\\ndoing business with certain customers or markets, including government customers, affect our ability to hire, attract and maintain qualified employees, or\\nrequire us to take remedial action or pay penalties. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from governmental agencies and regulators\\nregarding our compliance with laws and regulations or otherwise relating to our business or transactions. Any negative outcome from such inquiries or\\ninvestigations or failure to prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of\\noperations, and growth prospects.\\nWe have previously been, and are currently, or in the future may become, involved in a number of legal, regulatory, and administrative inquiries and\\nproceedings, and unfavorable outcomes in litigation or other of these matters could negatively impact our business, financial conditions, and results of\\noperations.\\nWe have previously been, and are currently, and from time to time going forward may become involved in and subject to regulatory or other governmental\\ninquiries or investigations, or government or private-party litigation or proceedings for a variety of claims or disputes. These claims, lawsuits, and proceedings\\nhave involved, and could in the future involve, labor and employment, discrimination and harassment, commercial disputes, intellectual property rights\\n(including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other proprietary rights), class actions, general contract, tort, defamation, data privacy rights, antitrust,\\ncommon law fraud, government regulation, or compliance, alleged federal and state securities and “blue sky” law violations or other investor claims, and other\\nmatters. Derivative claims, lawsuits, and proceedings involving breach of fiduciary duty, failure of oversight, corporate waste claims, and other matters have\\nbeen, and may in the future be, asserted against our officers and directors by our stockholders. In addition, we and certain of our officers and directors were\\nrecently sued in purported class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits. Our business and results may be adversely affected by the outcome of any currently\\npending or any future legal, regulatory, and/or administrative claims or proceedings, including through monetary damages or injunctive relief.\\nThe number and significance of our legal disputes and inquiries may increase as we continue to grow larger, as our business expands in employee headcount,\\nscope, and geographic reach, and as our platforms and services become more complex. Additionally, if customers fail to pay us under the terms of our\\nagreements, we may be adversely affected due to the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts through litigation. Litigation or other proceedings can be\\nexpensive and time consuming and can divert our resources and leadership’s attention from our primary business operations. The results of our litigation also\\ncannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to prevail in litigation, we could incur payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable\\nchanges to our platforms or business practices, and accordingly, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely\\naffected. Furthermore, if we accrue a loss contingency for\\n65\\nTable of contents\\npending litigation and determine that it is probable, any disclosures, estimates, and reserves we reflect in our financial statements with regard to these matters\\nmay not reflect the ultimate disposition or financial impact of litigation or other such matters. These proceedings could also result in negative publicity, which\\ncould harm customer and public perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\\nAdditional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is described further in Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies in our condensed\\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\\nAs we operate and sell our platforms and services around the world, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K.\\nBribery Act, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the United States Travel Act, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and\\nregulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both domestic and abroad. These laws and regulations generally prohibit improper payments or offers\\nof improper payments to government officials, political parties, or commercial partners for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an\\nimproper business advantage.\\nWe have operations, deal with and make sales to governmental or quasi-governmental entities in the United States and in non-U.S. countries, including those\\nknown to experience corruption, particularly certain emerging countries in East Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa, South America, and the Middle East, and further\\nexpansion of our non-U.S. sales efforts may involve additional regions.\\nCorruption issues pose a risk in every country and jurisdiction, but in many countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be more\\ncommon for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations, and our activities in these countries\\npose a heightened risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or third-party business partners, representatives, and agents\\nthat could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA. The FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may\\nhold us liable for acts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents. We and our third-party business\\npartners, representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated\\nentities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees or such third parties even if we do not explicitly authorize such\\nactivities. The FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and\\ncompliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have implemented policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we\\ncannot ensure that our employees or other third parties working on our behalf will not engage in conduct in violation of our policies or applicable law for which\\nwe might ultimately be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other laws may result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media\\ncoverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions, including suspension or\\ndebarment from U.S. government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities and adverse effects on our reputation, which could negatively affect\\nour business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant\\ndiversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Our exposure for violating these laws increases as\\nour non-U.S. presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.\\nGovernmental trade controls, including export and import controls, sanctions, customs requirements, and related regimes, could subject us to liability or\\nloss of contracting privileges or limit our ability to compete in certain markets.\\nOur offerings are subject to U.S. export controls, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our offerings. Our controlled software offerings and\\nthe underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, which may include license requirements\\nin some circumstances. Additionally, our current or future products may be classified under the Commerce Department Export Administration Regulations\\n(“EAR”) or as defense articles subject to the United States International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). Most of our products, including our core\\nsoftware platforms, have been classified under the EAR and are generally exportable without needing a specific license, under an EAR exception for encrypted\\nsoftware. If a product, or component of a product, is classified under the ITAR, or is ineligible for the EAR encryption exception, then those products could be\\nexported outside the United States only if we obtain the applicable export license or qualify for a different license exception. In certain contexts, the services\\nwe provide might be classified as defense services subject to the ITAR separately from the products we provide. Compliance with the EAR, ITAR, and other\\napplicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products, including new releases of our products and/or the performance of services, may create\\ndelays in the introduction of our products in non-U.S. markets, prevent our customers with non-U.S. operations from deploying our products throughout their\\nglobal systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether.\\n66\\nTable of contents\\nFurthermore, our activities are subject to the economic sanctions, laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Such controls prohibit the\\nshipment or transfer of certain products and services without the required export authorizations or export to countries, governments, and persons targeted by\\napplicable sanctions. We take precautions to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including: (i) seeking to proactively classify\\nour platforms and obtain authorizations for the export and/or import of our platforms where appropriate, (ii) implementing certain technical controls and\\nscreening practices to reduce the risk of violations, and (iii) requiring compliance with U.S. export control and sanctions obligations in customer and vendor\\ncontracts. However, we cannot guarantee the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws.\\nAs discussed above, if we misclassify a product or service, export or provide access to a product or service in violation of applicable restrictions, or otherwise\\nfail to comply with export regulations, we may be denied export privileges or subjected to significant per violation fines or other penalties, and our platforms\\nmay be denied entry into other countries. Any decreased use of our platforms or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platforms would likely adversely\\naffect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties, including\\ncivil penalties of over $300,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater, per EAR violation and a civil penalty of over $1,000,000 for ITAR\\nviolations. In the event of criminal knowing and willful violations of these laws, fines of up to $1,000,000 per violation and possible incarceration for\\nresponsible employees and managers could be imposed.\\nWe also note that if we or our business partners or counterparties, including licensors and licensees, prime contractors, subcontractors, sublicensors, vendors,\\ncustomers, shipping partners, or contractors, fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, notwithstanding regulatory requirements\\nor contractual commitments to do so, or if we fail to secure such contractual commitments where necessary, we may also be adversely affected, through\\nreputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties. For instance, violations of U.S. sanctions or\\nexport control laws can result in fines or penalties, including significant civil and criminal penalties per violation, depending on the circumstances of the\\nviolation or violations.\\nNegative consequences for violations or apparent violations of trade control requirements may include the absolute loss of the right to sell our platforms or\\nservices to the government of the United States, or to other public bodies, or a reduction in our ability to compete for such sales opportunities. Further,\\ncomplying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export\\npermitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platforms or could limit our customers’ abilities to\\nimplement our platforms in those countries. For example, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and other countries imposed economic\\nsanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine, and the United States and other countries could impose\\nwider sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Any new export restrictions, new legislation, changes in\\neconomic sanctions, or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons, or technologies targeted by such\\nregulations, could result in decreased use of our platforms by existing customers with non-U.S. operations, declining adoption of our platforms by new\\ncustomers with non-U.S. operations, limitation of our expansion into new markets, and decreased revenue.\\nChanges in accounting principles or their application to us could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, which could adversely affect our\\nresults of operations and growth prospects.\\nWe prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In particular, we make certain estimates and assumptions related to the\\nadoption and interpretation of these principles including the recognition of our revenue and the accounting for our provision for income taxes. If these\\nassumptions turn out to be incorrect, our financial results and position could materially differ from our expectations and could be materially adversely affected.\\nA change in any of these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations or application to us, may have a significant effect on our reported results, as well as\\nour processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously reported results or our forecasts, which may negatively impact our financial\\nstatements.\\nIf our judgments or estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of\\noperations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the\\namounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various\\nother assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Condition and Results of\\n67\\nTable of contents\\nOperations” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and\\nexpenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual\\ncircumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and\\ninvestors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock. Significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in preparing our\\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include, or may in the future include, those related to revenue recognition and income taxes.\\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Determining our provision for income taxes\\nrequires significant management judgment, and the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain. In addition, our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility\\nand could be adversely affected by many factors, including, among other things, changes to our operating or holding structure, changes in the amounts of\\nearnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in U.S. and foreign tax\\nlaws. Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which may\\ndisagree with our calculation of research and development tax credits, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, or other matters and assess additional taxes, interest\\nor penalties. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and we believe\\nthat our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover any such contingencies, there can be no assurance that the outcomes of such examinations will\\nnot have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes\\ncould increase, and our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\\nProvisions enacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental (“R&E”) expenditures became\\neffective on January 1, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2022, all U.S. and non-U.S. based R&E expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over five years and\\n15 years, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2022, we began capitalizing and amortizing R&E expenditures over five years for domestic research and 15 years\\nfor international research rather than expensing these costs as incurred.\\nMany countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-\\noperation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global\\ncorporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also\\ncontinuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the\\nimplementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). The Council of the European Union has adopted the global\\ncorporate 15% minimum tax as provided for in Pillar Two and has directed EU member states to implement legislation enacting Pillar Two by December 31,\\n2023. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate\\nincome taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax\\nrulings. Any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may\\nmaterially adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.\\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, which could adversely affect our results of\\noperations.\\nWe record an asset for the future tax benefits from unused U.S. federal, state, and non-U.S. net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax credits subject to a full\\nvaluation allowance. Federal, state, and non-U.S. taxing bodies often place limitations on NOLs and tax credit carryforward benefits. As a result, we may not\\nbe able to utilize our NOLs and tax credits. In general, under Section 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), a corporation that\\nundergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our\\nstock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. If our existing NOLs are\\nsubject to limitations arising from an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code, and a certain amount of our\\nprior year NOLs could expire without benefit. Changes in the law may also impact our ability to use our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards.\\nThere is also a risk that the expiration of our existing NOLs or tax credits or a limitation on their use to offset future income tax liabilities could result from\\nstatutory or regulatory changes, especially in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n68\\nTable of contents\\nOur results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes for our license arrangements in jurisdictions where we\\nhave not historically done so.\\nStates and some local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to\\nvarying interpretations that may change over time. We collect and remit U.S. sales and use tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), and goods and services tax (“GST”)\\nin a number of jurisdictions. It is possible, however, that we could face sales tax, VAT, or GST audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our\\nestimates as state and non-U.S. tax authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional tax amounts from our customers and remit those taxes\\nto those authorities. We could also be subject to audits in states and non-U.S. jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. One or more states or\\ncountries may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us or may determine that such taxes should have, but have\\nnot been, paid by us.\\nRisks Related to Relationships and Business with the Public Sector\\nA significant portion of our business depends on sales to the public sector, and our failure to receive and maintain government contracts or changes in the\\ncontracting or fiscal policies of the public sector has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition, and growth prospects.\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and government agencies, and we believe that\\nthe success and growth of our business will continue to depend on our successful procurement of government contracts. For example, we have historically\\nderived, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from sales to agencies of the U.S. federal government, either directly by us or\\nthrough other government contractors. Our perceived relationship with the U.S. government could adversely affect our business prospects in certain non-U.S.\\ngeographies or with certain non-U.S. governments.\\nSales to such government agencies are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to government agencies can be highly competitive, expensive, and\\ntime-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. We also must comply with\\nlaws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts, which provide public sector customers rights, many of which are\\nnot typically found in commercial contracts.\\nAccordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects may be adversely affected by certain events or activities, including,\\nbut not limited to:\\n•\\nchanges in fiscal or contracting policies or decreases in available government funding;\\n•\\nchanges in government programs or applicable requirements;\\n•\\nrestrictions in the grant of personnel security clearances to our employees;\\n•\\nability to maintain facility clearances required to perform on classified contracts for U.S. federal government and foreign government agencies;\\n•\\nability to achieve or maintain one or more government certifications, including, but not limited to, our existing FedRAMP, IL2, IL4, IL5, and IL6\\nauthorizations;\\n•\\nchanges in the political environment, including before or after a change to the leadership within the government administration, or due to the ongoing\\nRussia-Ukraine conflict and related economic sanctions and regional instability, and any resulting uncertainty or changes in policy or priorities and\\nresultant funding;\\n•\\nchanges in the government’s attitude towards the capabilities that we offer, especially in the areas of national defense, cybersecurity, and critical\\ninfrastructure, including the financial, energy, telecommunications, and healthcare sectors;\\n•\\nchanges in the government’s attitude towards us as a company or our platforms as viable or acceptable software solutions;\\n•\\nappeals, disputes, or litigation relating to government procurement, including but not limited to bid protests by unsuccessful bidders on potential or actual\\nawards of contracts to us or our partners by the government;\\n•\\nthe adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations;\\n•\\nbudgetary constraints, including automatic reductions as a result of “sequestration” or similar measures and constraints imposed by any lapses in\\nappropriations for the federal government or certain of its departments and agencies;\\n•\\ninfluence by, or competition from, third parties with respect to pending, new, or existing contracts with government customers;\\n•\\nchanges in political or social attitudes with respect to security or data privacy issues;\\n69\\nTable of contents\\n•\\npotential delays or changes in the government appropriations or procurement processes, including as a result of events such as war, incidents of terrorism,\\nnatural disasters, and public health concerns or epidemics, such as the coronavirus pandemic; and\\n•\\nincreased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays caused by other factors outside of our control, such as performance failures of our subcontractors.\\nSuch events or activities, among others, have caused and could continue to cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing\\nour platforms and services in the future, reduce the size or payment amounts of purchases from existing or new government customers, or otherwise have an\\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\\nWe have contracts with governments that involve classified programs, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from programs with governments and government agencies that are subject to security restrictions (e.g., contracts involving\\nclassified information, classified contracts, and classified programs), which preclude the dissemination of information and technology that is classified for\\nnational security purposes under applicable law and regulation. In general, access to classified information, technology, facilities, or programs requires\\nappropriate personnel security clearances, is subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability, and may also require appropriate facility clearances\\nand other specialized infrastructure. In the event of a security incident involving classified information, technology, facilities, or programs or personnel holding\\nclearances, we may be subject to legal, financial, operational, and reputational harm. We are limited in our ability to provide specific information about these\\nclassified programs, their risks, or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our\\nother businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business or our business overall. However, historically the business\\nrisks associated with our work on classified programs have not differed materially from those of our other government contracts.\\nOur business could be adversely affected if our employees cannot obtain and maintain required personnel security clearances or we cannot establish and\\nmaintain a required facility security clearance.\\nCertain government contracts may require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances and may require us to maintain a facility security\\nclearance to comply with U.S. and international government agency requirements. Many governments have strict security clearance requirements for personnel\\nwho perform work in support of classified programs. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees typically involves a lengthy process, and it\\ncan be difficult to identify, recruit, and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If our employees are unable to obtain security clearances in a\\ntimely manner, or at all, or if our employees who hold security clearances are unable to maintain their clearances or terminate employment with us, then we\\nmay be unable to comply with relevant U.S. and international government agency requirements, or our customers requiring classified work could choose to\\nterminate or decide not to renew one or more contracts requiring employees to obtain or maintain security clearances upon expiration. To the extent we are not\\nable to obtain or maintain a facility security clearance, we may not be able to bid on or win new classified contracts, and existing contracts requiring a facility\\nsecurity clearance could be terminated, either of which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nMany of our customer contracts may be terminated by the customer at any time for convenience and may contain other provisions permitting the customer\\nto discontinue contract performance, and if terminated contracts are not replaced, our results of operations may differ materially and adversely from those\\nanticipated. In addition, our contracts with government customers often contain provisions with additional rights and remedies favorable to such customers\\nthat are not typically found in commercial contracts.\\nMany of our contracts, including our government contracts, contain termination for convenience provisions. Customers that terminate such contracts may also\\nbe entitled to a pro rata refund of the amount of the customer deposit for the period of time remaining in the contract term after the applicable termination\\nnotice period expires. Government contracts often contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government customers with\\nadditional rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These rights and remedies allow government customers, among other things, to:\\n•\\nterminate existing contracts for convenience with short notice;\\n•\\nreduce orders under or otherwise modify contracts;\\n•\\nfor contracts subject to the Truth in Negotiations Act, reduce the contract price or cost where it was increased because a contractor or subcontractor\\nfurnished cost or pricing data during negotiations that was not complete, accurate, and current;\\n70\\nTable of contents\\n•\\nfor some contracts, (i) demand a refund, make a forward price adjustment, or terminate a contract for default if a contractor provided inaccurate or\\nincomplete data during the contract negotiation process and (ii) reduce the contract price under triggering circumstances, including the revision of price\\nlists or other documents upon which the contract award was predicated;\\n•\\ncancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\\n•\\ndecline to exercise an option to renew a multi-year contract or issue task orders in connection with indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”)\\ncontracts;\\n•\\nclaim rights in solutions, systems, or technology produced by us, appropriate such work-product for their continued use without continuing to contract for\\nour services, and disclose such work-product to third parties, including other government agencies and our competitors, which could harm our competitive\\nposition;\\n•\\nprohibit future procurement awards with a particular agency due to a finding of organizational conflicts of interest based upon prior related work\\nperformed for the agency that would give a contractor an unfair advantage over competing contractors, or the existence of conflicting roles that might bias\\na contractor’s judgment;\\n•\\nsubject the award of contracts to protest by competitors, which may require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance\\npending the outcome of the protest and may also result in a requirement to resubmit offers for the contract or in the termination, reduction, or modification\\nof the awarded contract;\\n•\\nsuspend or debar us from doing business with the applicable government; and\\n•\\ncontrol or prohibit the export of our services.\\nIf a customer were to unexpectedly terminate, cancel, or decline to exercise an option to renew with respect to one or more of our significant contracts, or if a\\ngovernment were to suspend or debar us from doing business with such government, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\\nmaterially harmed.\\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations, or contractual provisions applicable to our business could cause us to lose government customers or our ability to\\ncontract with the U.S. and other governments.\\nAs a government contractor, we must comply with laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, and performance of\\ngovernment contracts and inclusion on government contract vehicles, which affect how we and our partners do business with government agencies. As a result\\nof actual or perceived noncompliance with government contracting laws, regulations, or contractual provisions, we may be subject to audits and internal\\ninvestigations which may prove costly to our business financially, divert management time, or limit our ability to continue selling our platforms and services to\\nour government customers. These laws and regulations may impose other added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable\\nregulations and requirements, including non-compliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, penalties, and termination of\\ncontracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting for a period of time with government agencies. Any such damages, penalties, disruption,\\nor limitation in our ability to do business with a government could adversely impact, and could have a material adverse effect on, our business, results of\\noperations, financial condition, public perception, and growth prospects.\\nEvolving government procurement policies and increased emphasis on cost over performance could adversely affect our business.\\nFederal, state, local, and foreign governments and government agencies could implement procurement policies that negatively impact our profitability. Changes\\nin procurement policy favoring more non-commercial purchases, different pricing, or evaluation criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon\\nthe customer’s view of what our pricing should be may affect the predictability of our margins on such contracts or make it more difficult to compete on certain\\ntypes of programs.\\nGovernments and government agencies are continually evaluating their contract pricing and financing practices, and we have no assurance regarding the full\\nscope and recurrence of any study and what changes will be proposed, if any, and their impact on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\\nIncreased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and\\ncustomer relationships.\\nA substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding. Even if we are successful in obtaining an award, we may encounter bid protests\\nfrom unsuccessful bidders on any specific award. Bid protests could result, among other things, in significant expenses to us, contract modifications, or even\\nloss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of a contract award, the resolution can extend the time until contract activity can\\nbegin and, as a result, delay the\\n71\\nTable of contents\\nrecognition of revenue. We also may not be successful in our efforts to protest or challenge any bids for contracts that were not awarded to us, and we would be\\nrequired to incur significant time and expense in such efforts.\\nIn addition, governments and agencies increasingly have relied on competitive contract award types, including IDIQ and other multi-award contracts, which\\nhave the potential to create pricing pressure and to increase our costs by requiring us to submit multiple bids and proposals. Multi-award contracts require us to\\nmake sustained efforts to obtain orders under the contract. The competitive bidding process entails substantial costs and managerial time to prepare bids and\\nproposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors.\\nWe are experiencing increased competition while, at the same time, many of our customers are facing budget pressures, cutting costs, identifying more\\naffordable solutions, performing certain work internally rather than hiring contractors, and reducing product development cycles. To remain competitive, we\\nmust maintain consistently strong customer relationships, seek to understand customer priorities, and provide superior performance, advanced technology\\nsolutions, and service at an affordable cost with the agility that our customers require to satisfy their objectives in an increasingly price competitive\\nenvironment. Failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nThe U.S. government may procure non-commercial developmental services rather than commercial products, which could materially impact our future\\nU.S. government business and revenue.\\nU.S. government agencies, including our customers, often award large developmental item and service contracts to build custom software rather than firm\\nfixed-price contracts for commercial products. We sell commercial items and services and do not contract for non-commercial developmental services. The\\nU.S. government is required to procure commercial items and services to the maximum extent practicable in accordance with FASA, 10 U.S.C. § 2377; 41\\nU.S.C. § 3307, and the U.S. government may instead decide to procure non-commercial developmental items and services if commercial items and services are\\nnot practicable. In order to challenge a government decision to procure developmental items and services instead of commercial items and services, we would\\nbe required to file a bid protest at the agency level and/or with the Government Accountability Office. This can result in contentious communications with\\ngovernment agency legal and contracting offices, and may escalate to litigation in federal court. The results of any future challenges or potential litigation\\ncannot be predicted with certainty, however, and any dispute or litigation with the U.S. government may not be resolved in our favor; moreover, whether or not\\nit is resolved in our favor, such disputes or litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. These\\nproceedings could adversely affect our reputation and relationship with government customers and could also result in negative publicity, which could harm\\ncustomer and public perception of our business. The enforcement of FASA has resulted in a significant increase in our business with the U.S. federal\\ngovernment. Any change in or repeal of FASA, or a contrary interpretation of FASA by a court of competent jurisdiction, would adversely affect our\\ncompetitive position for U.S. federal government contracts.\\nA decline in the U.S. and other government budgets, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, or delays in contract awards have affected and may\\ncontinue to significantly and adversely affect our future revenue and limit our growth prospects.\\nBecause we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from contracts with governments and government agencies, and in particular from contracts with the\\nU.S. government and government agencies, our results of operations could be adversely affected by government spending caps or changes in government\\nbudgetary priorities, as well as by delays in the government budget process, program starts, or the award of contracts or orders under existing contract vehicles,\\nincluding as a result of a new U.S. administration. Current U.S. government spending levels for defense-related and other programs may not be sustained\\nbeyond government fiscal year 2023. Future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we\\ndo not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts. Such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of\\nshifts in spending priorities from defense-related and other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds and the number and intensity of\\nmilitary conflicts or other factors.\\nThe U.S. government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities which may shift Department of Defense budgetary priorities,\\nreduce overall spending, or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant\\nportion of our future revenue. A significant decline in overall U.S. government spending, a significant shift in spending priorities, the substantial reduction or\\nelimination of particular defense-related programs, or significant budget-related delays in contract or task order awards for large programs have affected and\\ncould continue to adversely affect our future revenue and limit our growth prospects.\\n72\\nTable of contents\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\\nThe public trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\\nPrior to the listing of our Class A common stock, there was no public market for shares of our Class A common stock. The market prices of the securities of\\nother recently public companies have historically been highly volatile. The public trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and may in the future\\nbe, subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, including those listed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, some of which are beyond our control.\\nThese fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above\\nthe price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the public trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\\n•\\nthe number of shares of our Class A common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\\n•\\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\\n•\\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\\n•\\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\\n•\\nsales or expected sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\\n•\\nshort-selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\\n•\\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to\\nmeet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n•\\nany financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new platforms, products, services or capabilities;\\n•\\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\\n•\\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;\\n•\\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\\n•\\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\\n•\\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\\n•\\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;\\n•\\nchanges in our management, including any departures of one of our Founders;\\n•\\nnew laws or regulations, public expectations regarding new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our\\nbusiness;\\n•\\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\\n•\\nany significant change in our management;\\n•\\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, including the\\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or responses to these events; and\\n•\\ngeneral macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation and interest rates and slow or negative growth of our markets.\\nIn addition, stock markets, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\\ncontinue to affect the trading prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, including technology companies, have fluctuated\\nin a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the trading\\nprice of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, including the\\nrecent purported class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits filed against us and certain of our officers and directors, could result in substantial costs and a\\ndiversion of our management’s attention and resources and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, in the future, we may be\\nthe target of additional litigation of this type.\\n73\\nTable of contents\\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all\\ndisputes between us and our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting\\na cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for\\ndisputes with us or our directors, officers, stockholders, or employees.\\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any\\nderivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former\\ndirectors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to, or seeking to\\nenforce any right, obligation or remedy under, any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,\\nor our amended and restated bylaws, (d) any action or proceeding as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of\\nChancery of the State of Delaware, or (e) any action or proceeding asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of\\nChancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or, if no state court in Delaware has\\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom, in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over\\nthe claims at issue and the indispensable parties; provided that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty\\ncreated by the Exchange Act.\\nSection 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities\\nAct actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions\\nand the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal\\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities\\nAct.\\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall be\\ndeemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe these exclusive forum provisions benefit us by providing\\nincreased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum\\nprovisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers,\\nstockholders, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our current and former directors, officers,\\nstockholders, or other employees. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and\\nregulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provisions. Further, in the event a court finds either exclusive forum provision contained in our\\namended and restated bylaws to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\\njurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets or the perception that sales might occur, including sales by our Founders\\nand their affiliates, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets or the perception that sales might occur, could cause the trading price of our\\nClass A common stock to decline.\\nIn addition to the supply and demand and volatility risk factors discussed above, sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the\\npublic market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur in large\\nquantities, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. As of March 31, 2023, approximately 6.2 million options will expire through\\nDecember 2023 if not exercised prior to their respective expiration dates, and we expect many holders will elect to exercise such options prior to expiration.\\nUpon exercise, the holders will receive shares of our Class A or Class B common stock, which may subsequently be sold.\\nAs of March 31, 2023, there were 2,013,043,925 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, 103,680,894 shares of our Class B common stock\\noutstanding and 1,005,000 shares of our Class F common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares may be immediately sold, although sales by our\\naffiliates remain subject to compliance with the volume limitations of Rule 144.\\nFurther, as of March 31, 2023, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 131,038,441 shares of our Class A common stock and 189,646,518\\nshares of our Class B common stock, and 71,234,336 shares of our Class A common stock and 45,825,000 shares of Class B common stock subject to RSUs.\\nAll shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans have been registered for sale under the Securities Act.\\nSubject to compliance with Rule\\n74\\nTable of contents\\n144 or the availability of an alternative exemption, the shares issued upon exercise of stock options or upon settlement of RSUs will be available for immediate\\nresale in the United States in the open market.\\nWhile the registration rights of our non-affiliates pursuant to our Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement dated August 24, 2020 requiring us to\\nregister shares owned by them for public sale in the United States have expired under the terms of that agreement, our affiliates who are party to the Amended\\nand Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement, including our Founders and certain of the entities affiliated with Peter Thiel, will retain the right to cause us to\\nregister shares held by them for resale until such rights terminate in accordance with our Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement. Any registration\\nstatement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise and whether in connection with the exercise of stock\\noptions, the settlement of RSUs, or the exercise or settlement of other awards or otherwise, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to\\ndecline or be volatile.\\nWe also may issue our capital stock or securities convertible into our capital stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or\\notherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to\\ndecline.\\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage certain types of transactions that\\nmay involve an actual or threatened acquisition of the Company, which will likely depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more\\ndifficult, including the following:\\n•\\nour multi-class common stock structure, which provides our Founders and their affiliates with the ability to effectively control the outcome of matters\\nrequiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock;\\n•\\nprior to the Final Class F Conversion Date (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), the holders of our common stock will only\\nbe able to take action by written consent if the action also receives the affirmative consent of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class F common\\nstock, and after such point the holders of our common stock will only be able to take action at a meeting of the stockholders and will not be able to take\\naction by written consent for any matter;\\n•\\nfrom and after the Final Class F Conversion Date, our Board of Directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\\n•\\ncertain transactions, other than restructuring transactions or transactions that otherwise do not involve a Change of Control (as defined in our amended and\\nrestated certificate of incorporation), which transactions require, pursuant to Section 251(c) or Section 271(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law,\\nthe approval of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon, will require\\napproval by the holders of at least 55.0% of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon if the record date\\nfor determining the stockholders entitled to vote to approve such transaction occurs prior to the Final Class F Conversion Date;\\n•\\ncertain transactions prior to the Final Class F Conversion Date, that would require disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, between any of\\nour Founders (or their controlled affiliates), on the one hand, and us, on the other, in which consideration exchanges hands between our Founders (or their\\ncontrolled affiliates) and us, and such consideration has a fair market value in excess of $50.0 million as determined in accordance with our amended and\\nrestated bylaws will require approval by either (i) the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock,\\nvoting together as a single class, or (ii) an Independent Committee (as defined in our amended and restated bylaws);\\n•\\nthe acquisition of our equity securities by our Founders (including their controlled affiliates), prior to the Final Class F Conversion Date, in a “Rule 13e-3\\ntransaction” (as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act) will be conditioned on approval by (i) an Independent Committee and (ii) the holders of a\\nmajority of the voting power of our capital stock that is held by our stockholders other than the Founders (including their controlled affiliates) and any\\nholder of the Class F Common Stock;\\n•\\nvacancies on our Board of Directors will be able to be filled only by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders;\\n•\\nour directors may only be removed as provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law;\\n•\\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President, or our\\nBoard of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directorships, whether or not there exist any vacancies\\nor other unfilled seats in previously authorized directorships;\\n75\\nTable of contents\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which\\nmay be issued without further action by our stockholders, except that any designation and issuance of preferred stock must receive the affirmative vote of a\\nmajority of the outstanding shares of our Class F common stock; and\\n•\\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of\\nstockholders.\\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also\\ndiscourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they\\ndesire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common\\nstock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they\\nchange their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the trading price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could\\ndecline.\\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our\\nbusiness, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our ordinary shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable\\nresearch about us, the trading price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If these analysts publish target prices for our Class A common stock that\\nare below the then-current public price of our Class A common stock, it could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline significantly.\\nFurther, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of Palantir or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could\\ndecrease, which might cause our Class A common stock trading price and trading volume to decline.\\nAlthough we currently are not considered to be a “controlled company” under the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) corporate governance rules, we\\nmay in the future become a controlled company due to the concentration of voting power among our Founders and their affiliates.\\nAlthough we currently are not considered to be a “controlled company” under the NYSE corporate governance rules, we may in the future become a controlled\\ncompany due to the concentration of voting power among our Founders and their affiliates resulting from the issuance of our Class F common stock. See\\n“Risks Related to the Multiple Class Structure of our Common Stock, the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, and the Founder Voting Agreement” below. A\\n“controlled company” pursuant to the NYSE corporate governance rules is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual,\\ngroup, or another company. In the event that our Founders and their affiliates or other stockholders acquire more than 50% of the voting power of the\\nCompany, we may in the future be able to rely on the “controlled company” exemptions under the NYSE corporate governance rules due to this concentration\\nof voting power and the ability of our Founders and their affiliates to act as a group. If we were a controlled company, we would be eligible, and could elect,\\nnot to comply with certain of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Such standards include the requirement that a majority of directors on our Board of\\nDirectors are independent directors, subject to certain phase-in periods, and the requirement that our compensation, nominating and governance committee\\nconsist entirely of independent directors. In such a case, if the interests of our stockholders differ from the group of stockholders holding a majority of the\\nvoting power, our stockholders would not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate\\ngovernance standards, and the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and corporate matters may be reduced.\\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion\\nof our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our credit\\nfacility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\\nConsequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any\\nfuture gains on their investment.\\n76\\nTable of contents\\nRisks Related to the Multiple Class Structure of our Common Stock, the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, and the Founder Voting Agreement\\nThe multiple class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with certain stockholders, in particular, our Founders and\\ntheir affiliates, which will effectively eliminate your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\\nOur Class A common stock has one (1) vote per share, and our Class B common stock has ten (10) votes per share with respect to each matter submitted to our\\nstockholders. Assuming that the Founders and certain of their affiliates collectively meet the Ownership Threshold (as defined below) on the applicable record\\ndate for a vote of the stockholders (except as provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), shares of Class F common stock will generally\\nhave a number of votes per share in respect of a matter submitted to our stockholders that would cause the total votes of all shares of Class F common stock,\\ntogether with the votes attributable to shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by our Founders and their affiliates that are subject to\\nthe voting agreement among our Founders and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the “Founder Voting Agreement”) and the votes attributable to shares\\nof Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by our Founders and their affiliates that are designated as Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares (as\\ndefined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), in each case entitled to vote on such matter, to equal, with respect to such matter,\\n49.999999% of the voting power of (i) all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on such matter (including in the case of the\\nelection of directors); or (ii) the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter only if a majority of the shares present in\\nperson or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter is the applicable voting standard (as applicable, “49.999999% of the Voting Power”).\\nAccordingly, subject to limited exceptions described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, such Founders\\nwill effectively control all matters submitted to the stockholders for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our\\norganizational documents, compensation matters, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate\\ntransaction requiring stockholder approval. Our Founders and their affiliates also hold the substantial majority of our outstanding Class B common stock.\\nBecause of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, even without regard to the voting power of the Class F common stock,\\nour Founders and their affiliates collectively control a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock based on their current ownership and may\\nsignificantly increase their ownership of Class B common stock in the future due to the exercise of currently outstanding warrants and stock options or the\\nsettlement of RSUs.\\nThe Founders may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your interests. This\\nconcentration of voting power is likely to have the effect of limiting the likelihood of an unsolicited merger proposal, unsolicited tender offer, or proxy contest\\nfor the removal of directors. As a result, our governance structure, including the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may have\\nthe effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and make it more difficult to replace\\nour directors and management.\\nThe Founder Voting Trust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement also have the effect of concentrating voting power with our Founders and their\\naffiliates, which will effectively eliminate your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\\nAll shares of our Class F common stock are held in a voting trust (the “Founder Voting Trust”), established by our Founders pursuant to a voting trust\\nagreement (the “Founder Voting Trust Agreement”) with Wilmington Trust, National Association as trustee (the “Trustee”). Our Founders are also currently\\nparty to the Founder Voting Agreement. Our Founders have agreed through the Founder Voting Trust Agreement and Founder Voting Agreement that all of the\\nshares of Class F common stock and all of the shares of our capital stock over which they and their affiliates have granted a proxy under the Founder Voting\\nAgreement will be voted in the manner instructed by a majority of our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement. Accordingly, together\\nwith the multiple class structure of our common stock and subject to limited exceptions described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and\\namended and restated bylaws, such Founders will effectively control all matters submitted to the stockholders for the foreseeable future, including the election\\nof directors, amendments of our organizational documents, compensation matters, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or\\nother major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.\\nUpon the withdrawal or removal of any of our Founders from the Founder Voting Agreement, including upon their death or disability, the remaining Founders\\nor Founder, as the case may be, will determine the manner in which the shares of our Class F common stock as well as the shares subject to the Founder Voting\\nAgreement are voted. In such cases, the voting power of our outstanding capital stock will be further concentrated among the remaining Founders, which may\\nbe as few as one. Further, if there are only two Founders who are party to the Founder Voting Agreement, one Founder will be able to effectively defeat any\\nstockholder action, except for the election of directors or other matters that are decided by a plurality of votes, if his instruction to vote the shares of Class F\\ncommon stock differs from the other Founder. The Founders who are then party to the Founder\\n77\\nTable of contents\\nVoting Agreement will retain the right to direct the voting of the Class F common stock without regard to their employment status with us.\\nAll shares of our Class F common stock are held in the Founder Voting Trust and voted pursuant to the Founder Voting Trust Agreement. Accordingly, our\\nFounders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will control any vote that requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our Class F\\ncommon stock, including action of our stockholders by written consent, the designation or issuance by us of shares of preferred stock, and certain amendments\\nto our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to our preferred stock.\\nAlthough we are a third-party beneficiary of the Founder Voting Agreement and the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, we do not have a general consent right\\nwith respect to amendments thereto, and either agreement may be amended or modified in the future in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders, which may\\ninclude increasing the ability of one or more of our Founders to exercise control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\\nIn certain circumstances in the future, the Founders and their affiliates could have voting power that exceeds 49.999999% of the Voting Power.\\nIf the voting power of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by the Founders or their affiliates that are subject to the Founder Voting\\nAgreement or are Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares collectively equals greater than 49.999999% of the Voting Power with respect to a matter submitted\\nto our stockholders, then the Class F common stock will have zero votes with respect to such matter. In this case, although the shares of our Class F common\\nstock would generally be entitled to zero votes per share on that matter, all of the shares that are then subject to the Founder Voting Agreement would continue\\nto be voted in accordance with the decision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement.\\nFor example, if the Founders and their affiliates hold shares other than the Class F common stock, such as Class B common stock, that, in the aggregate, have\\nvoting power that exceeds 49.999999% of the Voting Power with respect to a matter submitted to our stockholders, then the total voting power of the Founders\\nand their affiliates would exceed 49.999999% of the Voting Power with respect to such matter. Our Founders and their affiliates may acquire additional shares\\nof our Class A common stock or Class B common stock. Shares of our Class B common stock may be transferred (without converting into shares of Class A\\ncommon stock) to, among others, our Founders or their affiliates, and such transfers to our Founders or their affiliates could increase the total voting power of\\nthe Founders and their affiliates above 49.999999% of the Voting Power with respect to such matter. Excluding the voting power of the Class F common stock,\\nour Founders and their affiliates owned shares entitled to approximately 27.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in the aggregate as of\\nMay 1, 2023.\\nIn addition, if one or two Founders withdraw from the Founder Voting Agreement, the total voting power of the Founders and their affiliates in the aggregate\\ncould exceed 49.999999% of the Voting Power. For instance, if one Founder has withdrawn from the Founder Voting Agreement and such withdrawing\\nFounder votes his shares in the same manner as the shares of Class F common stock are voted pursuant to the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, then our\\nFounders and their affiliates, in the aggregate, could exercise 49.999999% of the Voting Power of our capital stock plus the voting power of shares held by the\\nwithdrawing Founder (which would no longer represent a subset of the 49.999999% of the Voting Power of our capital stock voted by those Founders that\\nremain party to the Founder Voting Agreement).\\nAs a result of future issuances of our common stock or the disposal of shares of our common stock by our Founders and their affiliates, our Founders and\\ntheir affiliates could have voting power that is substantially greater than, and outsized in comparison to, their economic interests and the percentage of our\\ncommon stock that they hold.\\nIn certain circumstances, our Founders and their affiliates could have voting power that is substantially greater than, and outsized in comparison to, their\\neconomic interests and the percentage of our common stock that they hold. This separation between voting power and economic interests could cause conflicts\\nof interest between our Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in our Founders undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be\\ndesirable for the Founders or their affiliates but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\\nIn the event that our Founders and their affiliates have less than 49.999999% of the Voting Power prior to giving effect to the voting power of the Class F\\ncommon stock, the issuance of additional shares by us in the future to stockholders other than our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting\\nAgreement or their affiliates will dilute the economic interests of our Founders but will generally not result in further dilution of the voting power of such\\nFounders and their affiliates. Because of the voting rights of the Class F common stock, such issuances will instead correspondingly increase the voting power\\nof the Class F common stock. Any future issuances of additional shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will not be subject to approval by\\nour stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the NYSE.\\n78\\nTable of contents\\nIn addition, our Founders and their affiliates are free to transfer or otherwise dispose of their shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock\\nwithout diminishing their voting power so long as our Founders and certain of their affiliates continue to collectively hold 100,000,000 Corporation Equity\\nSecurities (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) on the applicable record date (subject to equitable adjustments as provided in\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation) (the “Ownership Threshold”). Shares of our Class F common stock will not convert into shares of our\\nClass B common stock, and our multi-class structure will not terminate, solely because our Founders and certain of their affiliates do not satisfy this Ownership\\nThreshold on the applicable record date. Upon the withdrawal, or removal, of one or more of our Founders from the Founder Voting Agreement (including as a\\nresult of death or disability), the Ownership Threshold that must be met on the applicable record date will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the\\nownership of Corporation Equity Securities (which excludes Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares) of the Founders and certain of their affiliates as of August\\n10, 2020, which could substantially decrease the Ownership Threshold without reducing the effective voting power of the Class F common stock. Accordingly,\\nour Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will be able to achieve substantial liquidity in their holdings, and substantially diminish their\\neconomic interest in us, without diminishing their voting power.\\nFurthermore, meeting the Ownership Threshold on the applicable record date will not ensure that the Founders and their affiliates do not or will not have\\ndiffering economic interests from the interests of holders of the Class A common stock. For example, the Founder Voting Agreement does not prohibit a\\nFounder from hedging his economic exposure to our common stock; however, we have implemented a policy that will prohibit hedging by our directors,\\nofficers and employees, which currently includes the Founders. In addition, the trustee will vote shares of Class F common stock in accordance with the\\ndecision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement, regardless of such Founders’ relative ownership of any\\nclass of our common stock.\\nIn August 2020, we granted two of our Founders, Mr. Karp, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, and Mr. Cohen, our President\\nand a member of our Board of Directors, options and RSUs for an aggregate of 207.0 million shares of our Class B common stock (collectively, the “Founder\\nGrants”), the substantial majority of which remain subject to vesting, exercise, and/or settlement upon the future satisfaction of service conditions and certain\\nother conditions. These awards are expected to contribute to the Founders’ ability to meet the Ownership Threshold on the applicable record date at least until\\nthe sale of such shares by Mr. Karp and Mr. Cohen.\\nShares of our common stock designated by one or more of our Founders pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be voted or\\nnot voted by such Founders or their affiliates in their discretion and will reduce the voting power exercised in accordance with the decision of a majority in\\nnumber of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement.\\nMr. Thiel has identified a portion of the shares of Class B common stock and Class A common stock beneficially owned by him and his affiliates as Designated\\nFounders’ Excluded Shares, which will not be subject to the Founder Voting Agreement. Such Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares would reduce the total\\nvoting power that will be exercised in accordance with the decision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting\\nAgreement. Mr. Thiel or his affiliates would vote or not vote such Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares in their discretion, which may include in a manner\\ndifferent than the voting power exercised in accordance with the decision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting\\nAgreement. Depending on certain circumstances, including the extent to which other holders of Class B common stock convert or sell such shares of Class B\\ncommon stock, such Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares may have significant voting power and increase Mr. Thiel or his affiliates’ relative voting power\\ncompared to the other Founders. The shares identified by Mr. Thiel as Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares represented less than 5% of the voting power of\\nour outstanding capital stock as of May 1, 2023. In the future, Mr. Thiel or our other Founders could designate additional shares as Designated Founders’\\nExcluded Shares.\\nThe Ownership Threshold that must be met on any applicable record date is a small minority of our outstanding Corporation Equity Securities, and future\\nissuances of Corporation Equity Securities may decrease this percentage.\\nThe Ownership Threshold that must be met on any applicable record date is currently 100,000,000 Corporation Equity Securities, which is a small minority of\\nour outstanding Corporation Equity Securities. While the number of outstanding Corporation Equity Securities may exceed the number of shares of our\\noutstanding capital stock, as a comparison, there were 2,117,729,819 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2023. Except for certain\\nequitable adjustments as provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, future issuances of Corporation Equity Securities by us will not\\nincrease the Ownership Threshold that must be met on any applicable record date and, accordingly, will decrease the percentage of outstanding Corporation\\nEquity Securities represented by the Ownership Threshold.\\nUpon the withdrawal, or removal, of one or more of our Founders from the Founder Voting Agreement (including as a result of death or disability), the\\nOwnership Threshold that must be met on the applicable record date will be reduced on a pro rata basis\\n79\\nTable of contents\\nbased on the ownership of Corporation Equity Securities of the Founders and certain of their affiliates as of August 10, 2020. We expect that the Ownership\\nThreshold will be reduced by approximately 57 million Corporation Equity Securities upon the withdrawal or removal from the Founder Voting Agreement of\\nAlexander Karp, approximately 12 million Corporation Equity Securities upon the withdrawal or removal of Stephen Cohen, and approximately 31 million\\nCorporation Equity Securities upon the withdrawal or removal of Peter Thiel if such withdrawals or removals were to happen.\\nIn addition, in the future we could create a new class of equity securities with different economic or voting rights than existing classes. If we were to create a\\nnew class of equity security, because of the broad definition of “Corporation Equity Securities,” such security could qualify as Corporation Equity Securities\\nand therefore count towards the Ownership Threshold if held by our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement or certain of their affiliates.\\nIf such security has lesser or no economic rights, it could have the effect of further increasing the divergence between the economic interests of our Founders\\nwho are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement and their affiliates, on the one hand, and the voting power of such Founders and their affiliates, on the\\nother. Further, Corporation Equity Securities includes, among other things, any warrants, calls, options or other right, whether vested or unvested, to acquire\\nfrom the Company certain voting or equity securities from the Company. Accordingly, the Board of Directors could issue additional equity securities, or\\nadditional options, RSUs, warrants or other rights to acquire equity securities (whether vested or unvested), to our Founders or certain of their affiliates, which\\nwould increase the number of Corporation Equity Securities they hold and enable them to meet the Ownership Threshold notwithstanding sales of Corporation\\nEquity Securities that they currently hold. As a result, any Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement or certain of their affiliates could hold\\na nominal equity interest with little to no voting rights but meet the Ownership Threshold and therefore have voting power that provides effective control of our\\ncompany.\\nThe multiple class structure of our common stock features certain provisions that are novel or otherwise not common among other corporations with\\nmultiple class structures.\\nA number of provisions relating to the multiple class structure of our common stock are novel or otherwise not common among other corporations with\\nmultiple class structures. For instance, our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement are free to transfer or otherwise dispose of their\\nshares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock without diminishing their voting control so long as our Founders who are then party to the\\nFounder Voting Agreement and certain of their affiliates meet the Ownership Threshold on the applicable record date. Shares of our Class B common stock,\\nwhich have ten (10) votes per share, may remain outstanding in perpetuity. Additionally, shares of our Class B common stock may be transferred (without\\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock) to, among others, our Founders or their affiliates, which could result in our Founders and their affiliates or\\nother stockholders obtaining additional voting control.\\nAdditionally, certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to the calculation of the voting power of the Class F common\\nstock may have an adverse effect on our stockholders other than our Founders. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our Founders have\\nthe right to challenge the calculation of the voting power of the Class F common stock. Such a challenge may cause delays in the certification of any vote of\\nour stockholders or in the effectiveness of any action of our stockholders.\\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock, the Founder Voting Trust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement by which our Founders exercise\\neffective control over all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders will exist for the foreseeable future.\\nShares of our Class F common stock will convert automatically into shares of our Class B common stock only if the Founder Voting Trust Agreement or the\\nFounder Voting Agreement is terminated. Each of these agreements could remain in place until the death of our last living Founder. As of March 31, 2023, our\\nFounders were 55, 55, and 40 years old. Further, upon a discretionary or compulsory withdrawal of a Founder as a beneficiary of the Founder Voting Trust\\nAgreement, the Trustee will instruct our transfer agent and us to convert the withdrawing Founder’s pro rata portion of the shares of Class F common stock\\nheld in the Founder Voting Trust at the time of the withdrawal into shares of Class B common stock in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation.\\nBecause of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, even if the Class F common stock converts to Class B common stock,\\nour Founders will collectively control a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock based on their current ownership. Future transfers by\\nholders of shares of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as\\ncertain transfers effected for estate planning purposes and transfers between related entities. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common\\nstock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those individual holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the\\nlong term. If our Founders and their affiliates, individually or collectively, retain a significant portion of their holdings of Class B common stock for an\\nextended period of time, they could, in the future, individually or collectively, continue to control a significant portion of the combined voting power of our\\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock, even without the use of the Class F common stock, and such voting power could enable\\n80\\nTable of contents\\nholders of Class B common stock to effectively control all matters subject to the stockholder approval. Shares of our Class B common stock may remain\\noutstanding in perpetuity.\\nFurther, if all, or a large portion, of the Founder Grants should be exercised or vest and settle, our Founders will increase their voting power of our Class B\\ncommon stock. Although the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation only provide for a separate vote of the holders of our Class B\\ncommon stock on limited matters, under Delaware law, certain actions may require the approval of the holders of the Class B common stock voting as a\\nseparate class. For example, if we amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to adversely affect the special rights, powers, or preferences of\\nour Class B common stock in a manner that does not so affect the Class A common stock or Class F common stock, Delaware law could require approval of the\\nholders of our Class B common stock voting separately as single class. For any vote of the Class B common stock voting as a separate class, our Founders will\\nsignificantly influence such vote if all, or a large portion, of the Founder Grants should vest and settle and the Founders retain such shares.\\nOur governance structure may negatively affect the decision by certain institutional investors to purchase or hold shares of our Class A common stock.\\nThe holding of low-voting stock, such as our Class A common stock, may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors or may\\nbe less attractive to the portfolio managers of certain institutional investors. In addition, our multi-class governance structure may make us ineligible for\\ninclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track such indices\\nwould not invest in our stock. For example, from 2017 until recently, Standard & Poor’s did not allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-\\nclass capital structures to be included in their indices. These policies may depress our valuation compared to those of other similar companies that do not have\\nmulti-class governance structures.\\nFuture issuances of our Class A common stock will dilute the voting power of our Class A common stockholders but may not result in further dilution of\\nthe voting power of our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement.\\nFuture issuances of our Class A common stock will dilute the voting power of our Class A common stockholders, and future issuances to stockholders other\\nthan our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will dilute the economic interests of our Founders and their affiliates. However,\\nbecause of the voting rights of the shares of Class F common stock, in the event that our Founders and their affiliates have less than 49.999999% of the Voting\\nPower prior to giving effect to the voting power of the Class F common stock, future issuances of Class A common stock to stockholders other than our\\nFounders and their affiliates will generally not result in dilution of the voting power of our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement or\\ntheir affiliates, but rather, will correspondingly increase the voting power of the Class F common stock. Any future issuances of additional shares of Class A\\ncommon stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the NYSE.\\nGeneral Risk Factors\\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business.\\nOur business depends on the economic health of our current and prospective customers and overall demand for technology. In addition, the purchase of our\\nplatforms and services is often discretionary and typically involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources. Over the past year, the United\\nStates, the EU, and the U.K. have experienced historically high levels of inflation. In response to high levels of inflation and recession fears, the U.S. Federal\\nReserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England have raised, and may continue to raise, interest rates and implement fiscal policy interventions.\\nEven if these interventions lower inflation, they may also reduce economic growth rates, create a recession, and have other similar effects. A further downturn\\nin macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation and interest rates; supply chain disruptions; global political and economic uncertainty; geopolitical\\ntensions, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict; a lack of availability of credit; financial services sector instability; a reduction in business confidence\\nand activity; the curtailment of government or corporate spending; public health concerns or emergencies; financial market volatility; and other factors have in\\nthe past, and may in the future, negatively affect the industries to which we sell our platforms and services. Our customers may suffer from reduced operating\\nbudgets, which could cause them to defer, reduce, or forego purchases of our platforms or services. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions\\nby lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers, and the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall\\nspending on our offerings. Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions, a downturn in the technology sector or any sectors in which our\\ncustomers operate, or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions are stable, could adversely impact our business, financial\\ncondition, and results of operations in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our platforms and services, material default rates\\namong our customers, contract terminations or renegotiations by our customers, reduced sales of our platforms or services, and lower or no growth.\\n81\\nTable of contents\\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any crises, economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally, or for any industry in particular.\\nAlthough certain aspects of the effects of a crisis or an economic slowdown may provide potential new opportunities for our business, we cannot guarantee that\\nthe net impact of any such events will not be materially negative. Accordingly, if the conditions in the general economy and the markets in which we operate\\nworsen from present levels, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\nOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, JPY\\nand GBP. We expect our non-U.S. operations to continue to grow in the near term and we are continually monitoring our foreign currency exposure to\\ndetermine if we should consider a hedging program. Today, our non-U.S. contracts are denominated in either U.S. dollars or local currency, while our non-U.S.\\noperating expenses are often denominated in local currencies. However, as we expand our non-U.S. operations, a larger portion of our operating expenses may\\nbe denominated in local currencies and we may also hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional\\ncurrency. Volatility in exchange rates and global financial markets is expected to continue due to political and economic uncertainty globally.\\nDuring 2022, the U.S. dollar strengthened compared to other currencies, which increased and has the potential to increase in the future the real cost of our\\nplatforms to our customers outside of the United States, which could reduce demand for our platforms and adversely affect our financial condition and results\\nof operations. Continued increases in the value of the U.S. dollar and decreases in the value of foreign currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of our\\nrevenues being lower, result in increased expenses for our non-U.S. operations, or otherwise impact our financial condition and results of operations.\\nNatural disasters, including climate change, and other catastrophic events beyond our control could harm our business.\\nNatural disasters, including climate change, or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, non-U.S. commerce and the global\\neconomy, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, earthquakes, flooding, fire, power\\nshortages, pandemics such as COVID-19, terrorism, political unrest, cyberattacks including as may be exacerbated by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict,\\ngeopolitical tensions including those related to the invasion of Ukraine, the effects of climate change such as drought, wildfires, increased storm severity, and\\nsea level rise, telecommunications failure, vandalism, and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response\\nplans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, could decrease demand for our services, could make\\nexisting customers unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual requirements to us, including their payment obligations, and could cause us to incur\\nsubstantial expense, including expenses or liabilities arising from potential litigation. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense\\nthat we may sustain. Customer data could be lost, significant recovery time could be required to resume operations and our financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event.\\nIn addition, the impacts of climate change on the global economy and our industry are rapidly evolving. We may be subject to increased regulations, reporting\\nrequirements, standards or expectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with\\nclimate change, there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects\\nof climate change. For example, our Colorado headquarters have experienced and may continue to experience, climate-related events and at an increasing\\nfrequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with the wildfires.\\nAdditionally, while some employees have returned to our offices, it will remain difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees continuing to\\nwork remotely. Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical\\ninfrastructure in the United States and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our partners, suppliers, and customers, and may\\ncause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable\\nregulations could be impaired.\\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the listing standards of the NYSE.\\nThe requirements of these rules and regulations may continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more\\ndifficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\\nreporting. We have developed and refined our financial reporting and other disclosure controls and procedures, and will continue to do so. Our controls are\\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us\\n82\\nTable of contents\\nin the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that\\ninformation required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We\\nare also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting as our business continues to grow in size and complexity. We expect to continue to\\nhire and integrate additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate company experience and technical accounting knowledge, as well as implement\\nand integrate new technological systems. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our financial statement and disclosure controls and procedures\\nand internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-\\nrelated costs and significant management oversight.\\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, we have\\nidentified in the past, and may identify in the future, deficiencies in our controls. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties\\nencountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in\\na restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could\\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports. Ineffective\\ndisclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\\ninformation, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these\\nrequirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE. We are required to annually comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the\\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose.\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm must also formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually. Any\\nfailure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations\\naffecting public companies which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur greater legal, accounting, finance, and other expenses than we incurred as a private company.\\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\\nof 2010, and the rules and regulations of the NYSE. These requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\\ncompliance costs and have made, and will continue to make, some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\\nother things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. As a result of the complexity involved in\\ncomplying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management’s attention may be diverted from the day-to-day management of our\\nbusiness, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees to assist us in\\ncomplying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating\\nexpenses. Additionally, as a public company subject to additional rules and regulations and oversight, we may not have the same flexibility we had as a private\\ncompany.\\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies,\\nincreasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to\\nvarying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is\\nprovided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by\\nongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We have and intend to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws,\\nregulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention\\nfrom business operations to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by\\nregulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and\\nour business may be harmed.\\nWe also expect these rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept\\nreduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to\\nattract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as our executive officers.\\n83\\nTable of contents\\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other filings required of a public company, our business and financial\\ncondition has become more visible, which may result in an increased risk of threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If\\nsuch claims are successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are\\nresolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business,\\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\\nITEM 2.
