In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements\\nreflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed\\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the\\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed\\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and\\naccompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\\nevery five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023.

However, the Company may\\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\\ninterest rates.\\nForeign Exchange Risk\\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value\\nhedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–\\nrelated foreign currency transactions is 19 years.\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8\\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\nApril 1,\\n2023\\nSeptember 24,\\n2022\\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$\\n51,119 \\n$\\n102,670 \\nInterest rate contracts\\n$\\n19,375 \\n$\\n20,125 \\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$\\n111,696 \\n$\\n185,381 \\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\nSeptember 24, 2022\\nFair Value of\\nDerivatives Designated\\nas Accounting Hedges\\nFair Value of\\nDerivatives Not Designated\\nas Accounting Hedges\\nTotal\\nFair Value\\nDerivative assets :\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$\\n4,317 \\n$\\n2,819 \\n$\\n7,136 \\nDerivative liabilities :\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$\\n2,205 \\n$\\n2,547 \\n$\\n4,752 \\nInterest rate contracts\\n$\\n1,367 \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n1,367 \\n(1)\\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\\n(2)\\nDerivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed\\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally\\nenters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from\\ncontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective\\ncounterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party\\nto the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of\\ncollateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\nApril 1,\\n2023\\nSeptember 24,\\n2022\\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\\n$\\n14,651 \\n$\\n13,378 \\nCurrent and non-current term debt\\n$\\n(18,249)\\n$\\n(18,739)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\\nAccounts Receivable\\nTrade Receivables\\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized\\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the\\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any\\nrecourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\\nAs of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for\\n10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of April 1, 2023, the\\nCompany had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43%, 19% and 13%. As of\\nSeptember 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54%\\nand 13%.\\nNote 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\\nInventories\\nApril 1,\\n2023\\nSeptember 24,\\n2022\\nComponents\\n$\\n3,379 \\n$\\n1,637 \\nFinished goods\\n4,103 \\n3,309 \\nTotal inventories\\n$\\n7,482 \\n$\\n4,946 \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\\nApril 1,\\n2023\\nSeptember 24,\\n2022\\nGross property, plant and equipment\\n$\\n113,066 \\n$\\n114,457 \\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\\n(69,668)\\n(72,340)\\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net\\n$\\n43,398 \\n$\\n42,117 \\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\\nThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nSix Months Ended\\nApril 1,\\n2023\\nMarch 26,\\n2022\\nApril 1,\\n2023\\nMarch 26,\\n2022\\nInterest and dividend income\\n$\\n918 \\n$\\n700 \\n$\\n1,786 \\n$\\n1,350 \\nInterest expense\\n(930)\\n(691)\\n(1,933)\\n(1,385)\\nOther income/(expense), net\\n76 \\n151 \\n(182)\\n(52)\\nTotal other income/(expense), net\\n$\\n64 \\n$\\n160 \\n$\\n(329)\\n$\\n(87)\\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 10\\nNote 5 – Income Taxes\\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and\\n2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered\\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of\\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General\\nCourt of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September\\n25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing has been scheduled for May 23,\\n2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due\\nrelated to the State Aid Decision.\\nNote 6 – Debt\\nCommercial Paper\\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.

For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding\\nthe potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\\nstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”\\n“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly\\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\\nItem 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”\\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or\\nperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the\\n“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the\\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,\\ninvestor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance\\nmatters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not\\nincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\\nevery five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years\\n2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion during\\nthe second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022.

On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with\\nrespect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The\\nNorthern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and\\nissued an injunction.
